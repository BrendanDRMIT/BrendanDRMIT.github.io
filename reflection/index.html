<h2>Group Reflection</h2>



<h4> <em>What went well?</em>  </h4>



<p>The whole group performed well with this assessment. There was communication between the team members and ideas were encouraged. Having a word document within Microsoft Teams with tasks to be completed, enabled everyone to modify and track which tasks needed to be completed and have ownership of tasks that they completed.  </p>



<h4> <em>What could be improved?</em>  </h4>



<p>The team itself, improved and bonded better over time, getting to know each team members strength and knowledge was a plus for the team but a better way to communicate between team members would be a great improvement. Perhaps the use of Github as opposed to Microsoft teams may have allowed for all team members to more easily access the service and reduced the work required in generating logs for the assessment, and to gain more knowledge and familiarity of Git.  </p>



<h4> <em>At least one thing that was surprising?</em>  </h4>



<p>The surprising part of this group was the way team members just assigned themselves a task and ran with it. Communication between members was, at times, found to be easy and helpful, at times finding it surprisingly easy to have just a chat.  I was surprised with the functionality of MS Teams and how easy it made communications between team members as I had never used this service before.  </p>



<h4> <em>At least one thing you have learned about groups.</em>  </h4>



<p> One thing that has been learnt about this group is their willingness to contribute, knowing that each member wants to achieve the best possible result for the group as a whole. A second thing learnt would be how easily groups flow when there is a more systematic approach and everyone knows what they should be doing, or what others are already doing.   </p>



<h4> <em>Tools. </em>  </h4>



<p>The communication log between each member using Microsoft Teams enabled everyone to see and check their assigned tasks and the progress of other team members. This ensured that a task was not completed twice by other members and that each member knew what the other members were completing. We also used Wordpress to design and implement our website. All the work uploaded to MS Teams were then ported to the website.  </p>



<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>



<h4> Colin Batiste </h4>



<p>My perception of the group has been positive. The progress of the group at the start was slow as we were all trying to find our way around things with Microsoft Teams, but once established, communication and collaboration started to pick up between each of the group members. In the short time that the group has been formed, discussions about the tasks have been short but to the point and finding out what each group members strength is has work well in assigned tasks and projects. I feel that I have performed well for this assessment and that my contributed to the tasks will help this group achieve a high score, and if we were to continue as a group for other tasks and assessments the group itself would only improve. The one thing I have learned from this group is that everyone works at their own pace, but all are focused on achieving the same goal. </p>



<h4> Michael Souprounovich </h4>



<p> In my experience working with “That Team”, it was particularly good. Everyone in the team was very helpful, sociable and did their part. There weren’t any disagreements, fights etc. One bad thing about our team was that one or two people didn’t work at all – they didn’t even show up in our group discussion. I was surprised at how well we worked together; I have always had a bad experience with teamwork. I was also surprised that working in groups online is as good as face-to-face teamwork, as I have never worked in a group that only met online. I learnt that groups aren’t always a disaster zone, and that there are a multitude of very useful tools online that make group collaboration a piece of cake. We used Microsoft Teams as our communication platform. We were supposed to contribute to the website individually, our team did things a bit differently and we chose one person in our group to maintain the website, and everyone else just did all the writing and the website maintainer just took it and formatted it for the website. This was effective and we used WordPress to ensure that the construction of our website was quick and simple. </p>



<h4> Rahnny Tajaran </h4>



<p>  I think that one of the things that went well was having someone that stepped up as a leader. This led to things getting organised and someone who followed up on our group’s task. Also, one of our members were quick to make up a website. I guess one of the things that could be improved was the communication platform that we used. In all fairness, this was my first time using that platform and was confused at first, but I quickly got used to the features, so It was all fine. I think it would’ve been better if I quickly got on to the tasks that I have chosen to do. I think this set the team a little bit behind. Also, it would be a bit better if we voted first what kind of platform, we are comfortable using although I have found MS teams to be alright. One surprising thing was how well the team meshed together quickly. Everyone had already chosen which task or part of the assignment they wanted to do. I think I have learned that communication and teamwork are the two things that will make any group succeed. By working together, we can find solutions that works best. We were all working towards a common goal. </p>



<h4>Brendan Dilworth</h4>



<p>I feel like the team was organized fantastically, it was a
rocky start but once we had our Microsoft Teams set up it was super easy to
delegate tasks to each member and keep frequent communication. Roles were
easily identified and there was a clear leader who showed great management
skills keeping everybody on task. Microsoft teams allowed us to keep one word
document which updated live and limited having multiple copies of the same
document. Unfortunately we not all of the team members were able to connect by
Microsoft Teams which became out primary communications means, I feel like
having all team members in this group could have improved communications.
Knowing each others strengths and weaknesses moving forward I see improvement for
how we delegate tasks to play to each others strengths. I am genuinely
surprised how smoothly things ran once we got them together, most teams members
worked hard and seemed keen to get the work done. I learned that there needs to
be a clear management role in order to organise the group into sections and
delegate tasks. Secondly I Learnt that with the appropriate means for
communication and file management groups can become much more efficient. Microsoft
Teams allowed us to manage files, communicate between team members and delegate
tasks easily whilst keeping a communications log for all team members to see.
Our Github log activity only reflects work that has been done on the website as
we used an alternative service (MS Teams) for the rest of our group
organisation, however, I do believe that logs from MS teams should accurately
reflect the work being done for this group assignment. </p>
