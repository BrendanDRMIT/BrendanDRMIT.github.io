<p>That Team is a collaboration of 4 hardworking individuals
coming together to achieve the common goal of completing this assignment. Throughout
this assessment we have compared industry data and relevancy in the IT industry,
developed a better understanding of the day to day workings of an IT
professional, compared 4 different upcoming technologies and developed an
outstanding project idea. Unfortunately we did not use Github as out main means
of communication and merely as a means for hosting our website, however, we
have included an audit trail from Microsoft Teams which perfectly reflects our
groups work and each individuals input.</p>

<p>

I came to Australia over 20 years ago from England with the intension of having a better life, but most importantly giving my children a better life. Up until we emigrated, I lived just outside London being the stereotypical ‘Eastender / cockney’. Completed senior school with enough to get me a job and thought life. After completing school, I started an electrical apprenticeship’ and became an electrician after 4 long years, since then I have been an electrician all of my working life. Since the IT industry has merged more and more into the electrical trade, I became more interested in it and since being in Australia I have completed a Diploma in IT which I have great pride in, and it has also helped in the aspects of my trade.

<p><a href="https://misha-ate-soup.github.io/RMITAssignment/index.html">https://misha-ate-soup.github.io/RMITAssignment/index.html</a></p>



<p> I was born and grew up in Melbourne. Some of my great-grandparents came from Russia, and some from Britain. I have completed primary school at Eastwood Primary School and have been studying at home for my secondary school education. I have completed two online courses prior to this one – The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) part one and two. Certificate of completion is available here and here. I currently communicate using Auslan, and written English. Since I am deaf, I cannot hear or speak English. Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing with my go-kart, and programming games in Lua on my Ti-Nspire CX CAS calculator. My interest in IT officially began when I was about eight years  old, and my neighbour left her old computer on her nature strip, so I brought it home and connected it and got it to work successfully. </p>

<p>

I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology and Working full time in the Hospitality industry. I was born in the Philippines and migrated here when I was 17. I speak Filipino and English. My favourite sport is basketball. I have a daughter; her name is Zoe and she means the world to me. My interest in IT is programming and cybersecurity. It started when I was in high school. I was always good with computers and when my family have troubles with them, I was the one they always go to. My interest sparked in cybersecurity when I first watched Mr. Robot. I liked the idea of defending cyberattacks and strategizing against hackers. What makes a good I.T person and what path to take in the industry? I really would love to learn more of the technical side of I.T because it interests me the most.

</p>



<h2> Brendan Dilworth </h2>



<h4> Student number s3750271 </h4>



<p><a href="https://brendand-byte.github.io/">https://brendand-byte.github.io/</a></p>



<p> My interests in I.T. started at a young age, I loved playing games and through school started learning about databases and doing some light coding. I always enjoyed taking old computers apart although I had no idea what I was doing and learning about all of the different hardware components. I have experiences doing light coding, developing robots, using a 3D printer and mechanical components, and developing websites from previous studies or personal interest. Through my studies, am hoping to develop a better understanding of what tools there are out there that I can implement them into my financial planning career, to make my own job easier and better help my future clients. In the future, I would love to develop a program which uses statistical techniques to analyse investment options based on an outlines risk profile and historic data from the ASX. </p>

<h4>Reflection</h4>



<p>

With these results of the team, there is a good cross section of personalities that will not clash. The team as a whole, consists of a cross section of people that are productive and dedicated. They are problem solvers that want to look to the future rather than the past. There are members of the team that will keep the team organised and on track and I feel this team will work well together to produce the end result.

</p>



<h2>Our Ideal Jobs Compared</h2>



<p>With
the group members of this team there is no common element as such with the
ideal jobs. Each person has a different field in IT that their ideal job
requires, Programing, Data Analysts, Cyber Security and Networking. The
difference in these areas cover a main part of the IT industry, from the hard
wiring to programming to analyzing software and security. With this team’s
career plans being so different, it seems to me, that it would be possible for
this team to form an IT company that could offer an IT service from start to
finish.</p>



<h2>Audit Trail</h2>



<p>[9/30 2:56 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I’m here!</p>



<p>[9/30 5:18 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Mike, how things going with your assessment 2 and weekly tasks? My weekly are going ok, Assessment 2 have started to do ‘IT Technologies’ and hope to get ‘IT Work’ done soon</p>



<p>[9/30 9:00 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey Colin Batiste, i’m a bit behind in weekly tasks so I am trying to catch up this week. I haven’t started on Assessment 2, we probably should wait for the others to show up…</p>



<p>[10/3 9:19 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I’m doing the IT Technologies for the Raspberry Pi and Robots reports, so don’t do them – that’s my job!</p>



<p>[10/4 3:31 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey Brendan Dilworth, can we have a look at the website? Can you give us a link to it?</p>



<p>[10/5 2:15 PM] Brendan Dilworth of course! Url is that-team.com (If it doesn’t work get rid of the “www.”) Github repository URL: https://github.com/BrendanDRMIT/BrendanDRMIT.github.io.git</p>



<p>[10/5 6:57 PM] Michael Souprounovich Thanks much! Did you use WordPress or some other website creating tool?</p>



<p>[Monday 7:21 AM] Brendan Dilworth using wordpress but because they want the site hosted by github i’m having to convert it to a static site and upload the site files into the github repository after every edit.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:41 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Rahnny if you can do the Industry Data that would be great, You will have to go to the GitHub sites of all of us and work from that information. I would work on the information you have at the moment with our sites and when the others join, add their info into it. Don’t want to have a big panic near time of submission.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:26 AM] Rahnny Tajaran Hey guys! This is my first time using ms teams.. I had a look at the website and it looks cool! I will try and do the industry data report if no one has started it yet 🙂</p>



<p>[Monday 6:08 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey Rahnny, we have 3 IT tech reports done, and I’m working on the last one, so yeah, it would be awesome if you could do the industry data, as Colin Batiste said.</p>



<p>[10/5 8:30 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I have uploaded the report for the Raspberry Pi for IT Technologies to the Files tab. Obviously it is not perfect, and I am having a little problem with the last section – how it will affect life. I am having difficulty in finding something to write about. Contributions and suggestions will be greatly appreciated! I am now working on the robots report.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:09 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Michael i have added a bit to the end of your Raspberry Pi. Have a look and either reword or scrap, what ever you think fit</p>



<p>[Monday 6:08 PM] Michael Souprounovich Thanks mate! I’ll have a look now. It’s perfect! Thanks!</p>



<p>[10/3 12:45 AM] Colin Batiste Hi all, I have put a doc in the Files Tab (above). in it you can see what has been done and what hasn’t. Please pick any item to be done, put your name next to it and complete ready for submission. Brendan if you have completed the items with a (?) put a Done in there. Also are you happy with us sending you the Tasks for you to post on the web site?</p>



<p>[10/4 3:12 PM] Brendan Dilworth of course, send them through, i’ll post them to the site.</p>



<p>[10/5 1:10 AM] Colin Batiste Hi Brendan I have uploaded IT Work if it posts on the web site alright then I will upload other docs. Everybody else, have a look and see what you think.</p>



<p>[10/5 2:10 PM] Brendan Dilworth I have uploaded this into the tasks section of the website (that-team.com) go check it out and let me know what you think, it is still very bare as I havent received any content yet besides the IT work.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:20 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Brendan The (that-team.com) link is is a dead link for me, it points me to www.that-team.com is that right?</p>



<p>[Monday 6:11 PM] Michael Souprounovich No, it doesn’t have the www. Just type “that-team.com” into your browser’s search bar.</p>



<p>[Monday 9:02 PM] Colin Batiste hi Brendan web site looks great, thank-you, thanks Michael for pointing me in the right direction. My web site in assessment 1 sucks, big time, hope what I have is ok for this assessment. Brendan Iv uploaded a new version of IT Work as I think all submissions are to be in ‘Harvard Style’.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:08 PM] Brendan Dilworth Great, i’ll check it out and upload it to the site</p>



<p>[Monday 9:29 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan i have also uploaded 2 new docs, for the ‘IT Technologies’ section, Blockchain and Machine Learning</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:09 PM] Brendan Dilworth Great i’ll check it out and upload it to the site</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:13 PM] Brendan Dilworth Lets try and chase down those last 2 websites and i’ll see what i can do on the site to make it look good, Maybe putting them in as buttons with a little snip of each persons profile?</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:18 PM] Michael Souprounovich Sounds good!</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:19 PM] Colin Batiste iv sent them another message in Canvas, working that they will not be comeing</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:23 PM] Michael Souprounovich The others aren’t coming? What do you mean?</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:24 PM] Colin Batiste have not heard from them since we started, not sure if they are still here</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:29 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan if you could post your github web site i can complete the Personal Information part also it will help Rahnny with his Industry Data.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:31 PM] Colin Batiste Michael hows Robots going?</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:32 PM] Michael Souprounovich Good, about halfway done. Working on it right now.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:38 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan, Rahnny, Michael, Alexander, Chol Everybody we need to have an idea for a Project Idea. My assessment 1 was to have automated street lighting</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:40 PM] Michael Souprounovich Colin Batiste Mine was to emulate a old video game console in Minecraft. Maybe a little too technical for everyone…</p>



<p>[Tuesday 3:11 PM] Rahnny Tajaran Mine was an app for combatting plastic pollution and raising awareness.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 3:23 PM] Brendan Dilworth My Project idea was an AI investor program using historic data compared against an individuals risk profile and asset allocation preferences to recommend buying and selling assets to continuously balance risk and maximise profit.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 6:13 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hello everyone, I have completed the robots report. Please refer to the file I have uploaded.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 9:05 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan, Michael, Rahnny Ok everyone Assessment 2 has to be submitted by end of this week, lots to do. Brendan don’t submit to web site yet as all information has to be in 1 PDF doc then submitted. All submissions have to be in the Harvard Style format, Michael im going to reformat your Pi and Robots to that style. Rahnny you should have the Industry Data information you need now to complete. All of the Project Ideas are great i don’t think we should think of a new one so im ok with Brendan’s ( as long as you can have it done by the end of the week). Feedback looks like we don’t have to do (its not working)</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:22 AM] Colin Batiste Rahnny hows the Industry Data going? if any problems let me know. Also could you submit a 200 word report for Group Reflection</p>



<p>[Tuesday 10:21 PM] Colin Batiste Michael i have altered your reports, if happy with them let me know</p>



<p>[Yesterday 7:33 AM] Michael Souprounovich Looks good, thanks!</p>



<p>[Yesterday 7:35 AM] Michael Souprounovich Colin Batiste, anything else you want me to do?</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:19 AM] Colin Batiste Hi Michael glad you like it. In Group Reflection we all have to submit 200 words each and 400 words as a group, if you want to do that? I will be working on my 200 words soon.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:27 AM] Michael Souprounovich I’m on it.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 3:01 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I have completed my group reflection and have uploaded the file.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 1:40 PM] Michael Souprounovich Colin Batiste are we supposed to do the 7.2.1 task – writing a report for our company? https://rmit.instructure.com/groups/159488/discussion_topics/506747?module_item_id=1868406 I can do it myself if it is OK with everyone?</p>



<p>[Yesterday 4:33 PM] Colin Batiste Posted….. 7.2.1 Group doc</p>



<p>[Tuesday 10:57 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan could you upload your GitHub site so that I can complete the Personal Information</p>



<p>[Yesterday 6:49 PM] Brendan Dilworth I have been doing some updates to my site to make it cleaner. I have uploaded it now</p>



<p>[Yesterday 6:53 PM] Michael Souprounovich Neat!</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:28 AM] Colin Batiste Brendan is Project Ideas still ok? Also could you submit a 200 word report for Group Reflection and comments for Tools and don’t forget the GitHub site</p>



<p>[Yesterday 8:52 PM] Brendan Dilworth I have just uploaded my group reflection and project idea (this is the same as on my site) give me some feedback if you guys want to add anything or whatever.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 9:34 PM] Colin Batiste Hi all have uploaded Team Profile and my Group Reflection</p>



<p>[1:35 AM] Colin Batiste Brendan Michael Rahnny I have uploaded Group Reflection Team, it needs to be about 400 words long. please add something to it. thanks</p>



<p>[3:26 PM] Brendan Dilworth check out this link and let me know what you think, if you like it i will format all like this. http://that-team.com/2019/10/10/raspberry-pi-report/</p>



<p>[1:37 PM] Colin Batiste Hello Brendan, Michael and Rahnny Well this is almost it, I feel the submitted tasks are great, Rahnny please upload Industry Data and your Group Reflection.</p>



<p>I think their only 3 other items to do, Ideal Jobs, Comments in Tools and for everybody to chip in to Group Reflection Team. Feedback in SparkPLUS will need to be done by all of us also. Don’t forget the assessment has to be submitted this week as a PDF Report, you ok to do that Brendan? Im not going to be here for the next few days but will catch up with you all at the weekend.</p>



<p>[2:05 PM] Brendan Dilworth To confirm, What exactly would you like me to do ? do you want me to upload all onto the website and print each page into the same pdf ?</p>



<p>[2:33 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Brendan, I think the tasks need to be “Formatted and presented in a PDF Report” then uploaded to the group site.</p>



<p>Not sure if in 1 PDF or a PDF for each task, im thinking a PDF for each task</p>



<p>[2:37 PM] Brendan Dilworth Okay, interesting. what I might do is upload them individually as group posts (this will look nice) and I will include a link on each post with a PDF version. what i can then do is collate all of them into one pdf containing the whole assignment and link that on the home page. just to be sure.</p>



<p>[2:40 PM] Colin Batiste Sound good to me</p>



<p>[2:48 PM] Colin Batiste Over the next day or so check if Rahnny has submitted his parts</p>



<p>[2:49 PM] Colin Batiste Im trying to get the IDEAL JOBS part done</p>



<p>[3:06 PM] Brendan Dilworth so all that’s left for me to do is the site stuff ? (converting to pdf’s and uploading to the site)</p>



<p>[3:13 PM] Colin Batiste ‘Comments on how well the audit trail reflects the groups work’</p>



<p>Add something to the GROUP Reflection</p>



<p>Complete SparkPLUS</p>



<p>Check for Rahnnys reports</p>



<p>Upload in a few days and have a beer</p>



<p>[3:27 PM] Brendan Dilworth so i have looked back over the task sheet, will we be submitting an activity log from Microsoft teams? i assume they will reference this for ” how well the audit trail reflects the groups work”</p>



<p>[3:31 PM] Colin Batiste Web Site looks great</p>



<p>[3:32 PM] Colin Batiste Have looked into downloading the logs for our chat but MS Teams hasn’t enabled that to be done yet</p>



<p>[3:33 PM] Colin Batiste either its screen shots or cut and paste</p>



<p>[3:39 PM] Brendan Dilworth could we maybe include a link to the channel ? (like the one below)(https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a237daa52a78d4ee7812961b010cd37a5%40thread.skype/General?groupId=3ff58a2b-4fda-498a-a66f-60c543b282a9&tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b)</p>



<p>[3:35 PM] Colin Batiste Have just uploaded Ideal Jobs, bit rushed, see what you think</p>



<p>[3:40 PM] Brendan Dilworth Cheers Colin, i’m trying to get as much work done this arv as i can so will have a look.</p>



<p>[4:23 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan had a look at the link, i don’t think it will work as permission would need to be given to whoever want to access teams im looking at other way to do it</p>



<p>[4:24 PM] Brendan Dilworth I thought this might be the case but was unsure, let me know how you go</p>



<p>[Thursday 4:51 PM] Colin Batiste OK i think i have cut and paste all of the chat</p>



<p>Will work on it later and upload Friday night or Saturday</p>



<p>[Thursday 4:53 PM] Colin Batiste Have to go now, will log in over the weekend</p>



<p>[Thursday 3:26 PM] Brendan Dilworth check out this link and let me know what you think, if you like it i will format all like this. http://that-team.com/2019/10/10/raspberry-pi-report/</p>

<p>[Yesterday 1:05 AM] Rahnny Tajaran Hey guys my apologies currently dealing with family issues but will be looking to finish the report soon..</p>



<p>[Yesterday 8:42 AM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I have completed my feedback on this group on sparkPLUS. I am not sure if my feedback is available for everyone to see…</p>



<p>[Yesterday 1:25 PM] Rahnny Tajaran Hi Team, I have uploaded the industry data report. I am not sure if the format is correct but feel free to correct any mistakes. Apologies on the delay. I will now be doing the group reflection.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 3:54 PM] Brendan Dilworth Hey all, go check out the website (http://that-team.com/) i’m still waiting on some content from you guys, if I could get that posted in here tonight would be great so that I can upload it to the site tomorrow. If you make any edits to anything already on the site, make sure that you let me know so that I can update it. In the PDF page on the website i will collate all of the individual files into one pdf and post it there, i will also generate a pdf for each page on the site and merge them. this will look nicer and more formatted compared to the alternative. still a bit to do so the sooner we can get the remaining content complete the better!</p>



<p>[Yesterday 7:49 PM] Michael Souprounovich It’s looking great!</p>
