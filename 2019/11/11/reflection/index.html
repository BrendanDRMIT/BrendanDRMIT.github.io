<h2><strong>Group Reflection</strong></h2>



<h4><em>What went well?</em>  </h4>



<p>The whole group performed well with this
assessment. There was communication between the team members and
ideas were encouraged. Having a word document within Microsoft Teams with tasks
to be completed, enabled everyone to modify and track which tasks needed to be
completed and have ownership of tasks that they completed. </p>



<h4><em>What could be
improved?</em> </h4>



<p>The team itself, improved and bonded better over time,
getting to know each team members strength and knowledge was a plus for the
team but a better way to communicate between team members would be a great
improvement. Perhaps the use of Github as opposed to Microsoft teams
may have allowed for all team members to more easily access the service and
reduced the work required in generating logs for the assessment, and to gain
more knowledge and familiarity of Git. </p>



<h4><em>At least one
thing that was surprising?</em> </h4>



<p>The surprising part of this group was the way
team members just assigned themselves a task and ran with it.
Communication between members was, at times, found to be
easy and helpful, at times finding it surprisingly easy to
have just a chat.  I was surprised with the functionality of MS Teams and
how easy it made communications between team members as I had never used this
service before. </p>



<h4><em>At least one
thing you have learned about groups.</em>  </h4>



<p>One thing that has been learnt about this group is
their willingness to contribute, knowing that each member wants to achieve
the best possible result for the group as a whole. A second thing
learnt would be how easily groups flow when there is a more systematic approach
and everyone knows what they should be doing, or what others are already doing. </p>



<h4><em>Tools. </em> </h4>



<p>The communication log between each member using Microsoft
Teams enabled everyone to see and check their assigned tasks and the progress
of other team members. This ensured that a task was not completed twice by
other members and that each member knew what the other members were completing.
We also used Wordpress to design and implement our website. All the
work uploaded to MS Teams were then ported to the website. </p>



<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>



<h4>Colin Batiste</h4>



<p>My perception of the group has been positive. The progress of
the group at the start was slow as we were all trying to find our way around
things with Microsoft Teams, but once established, communication and
collaboration started to pick up between each of the group members. In the
short time that the group has been formed, discussions about the tasks have
been short but to the point and finding out what each group members strength is
has work well in assigned tasks and projects. I feel that I have performed well
for this assessment and that my contributed to the tasks will help this group
achieve a high score, and if we were to continue as a group for other tasks and
assessments the group itself would only improve. The one thing I have learned
from this group is that everyone works at their own pace, but all are focused
on achieving the same goal.</p>



<h4>Michael Souprounovich </h4>



<p>In my experience working with “That Team”, it was
particularly good. Everyone in the team was very helpful, sociable and did
their part. There weren’t any disagreements, fights etc. One bad thing about
our team was that one or two people didn’t work at all – they didn’t even show
up in our group discussion. I was surprised at how well we worked together; I
have always had a bad experience with teamwork. I was also surprised that
working in groups online is as good as face-to-face teamwork, as I have never
worked in a group that only met online. I learnt that groups aren’t always a
disaster zone, and that there are a multitude of very useful tools online that
make group collaboration a piece of cake. We used Microsoft Teams as our
communication platform. We were supposed to contribute to the website
individually, our team did things a bit differently and we chose one person in
our group to maintain the website, and everyone else just did all the writing
and the website maintainer just took it and formatted it for the website. This
was effective and we used WordPress to ensure that the construction of our
website was quick and simple.</p>

<h4>Rahnny Tajaran </h4>



<p>I think that one of the things that went well was having
someone that stepped up as a leader. This led to things getting organised and
someone who followed up on our group’s task. Also, one of our members were
quick to make up a website. I guess one of the things that could be improved
was the communication platform that we used. In all fairness, this was my first
time using that platform and was confused at first, but I quickly got used to
the features, so It was all fine. I think it would’ve been better if I quickly
got on to the tasks that I have chosen to do. I think this set the team a
little bit behind. Also, it would be a bit better if we voted first what kind
of platform, we are comfortable using although I have found MS teams to be
alright. One surprising thing was how well the team meshed together quickly.
Everyone had already chosen which task or part of the assignment they wanted to
do. I think I have learned that communication and teamwork are the two things
that will make any group succeed. By working together, we can find solutions
that works best. We were all working towards a common goal.</p>



<h4>Brendan Dilworth</h4>



<p>I feel like the team was organized fantastically, it was a
rocky start but once we had our Microsoft Teams set up it was super easy to
delegate tasks to each member and keep frequent communication. Roles were
easily identified and there was a clear leader who showed great management
skills keeping everybody on task. Microsoft teams allowed us to keep one word
document which updated live and limited having multiple copies of the same
document. Unfortunately we not all of the team members were able to connect by
Microsoft Teams which became out primary communications means, I feel like
having all team members in this group could have improved communications.
Knowing each others strengths and weaknesses moving forward I see improvement
for how we delegate tasks to play to each others strengths. I am genuinely
surprised how smoothly things ran once we got them together, most teams members
worked hard and seemed keen to get the work done. I learned that there needs to
be a clear management role in order to organise the group into sections and
delegate tasks. Secondly I Learnt that with the appropriate means for
communication and file management groups can become much more efficient.
Microsoft Teams allowed us to manage files, communicate between team members
and delegate tasks easily whilst keeping a communications log for all team
members to see. Our Github log activity only reflects work that has been done
on the website as we used an alternative service (MS Teams) for the rest of our
group organisation, however, I do believe that logs from MS teams should
accurately reflect the work being done for this group assignment.</p>
