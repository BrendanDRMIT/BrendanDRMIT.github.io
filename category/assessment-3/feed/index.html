<h4>Topic</h4>



<p>The existing running cost for a streetlight is $0.21195/KWh, (Ergon Energy), with each motorway lamp being about 250 Watts, the electrical running cost per lamp is in the region of $232 per year, and on a suburban street this equates to about $88.00 per year this is with a 95-Watt lamp.</p>



<p>On a length of motorway there are about 22 streetlights per kilometre of road, whereas in suburban streets there are about 28 streetlamps per kilometre (Energyrating.gov). The resulting lighting cost to the government is estimated at $5104 and $2464 respectively, per year per kilometre of lit road. Although there are initiatives currently underway within the industry, specifically the Street Lighting Smart Controls program (SLSC) governed by the Institute of Public Works Engineering Australia (IPWEA), we don’t think that this is enough. These initiatives are majorly concerned with rolling out new LED lighting in streetlamps and too reduce costs with a lesser focus on the intelligent integration of the use of these streetlamps within society. The focus needs to be on the intelligent integration of communications devices to assist in the development of an intelligent system which not only reduces the environmental impact of our street lighting have, but also to improve the safety of drivers, and emergency services.</p>



<p>In this day and age communications devices make up so much of our day to day life and more importantly for our project, our driving experiences. Whether you’re following Google Maps on your way home, streaming music from Spotify, or on the phone with your loved ones; all of these services use some sort of frequency which</p>



<p>we can track and use to predict your actions. The primary use of our service would be to take advantage of live GPS updates and signals from streaming services or telephone towers from one’s communications devices to predict their movements along a path and pre-emptively light their way. This method of lighting will enable us to light only the roads which are under use and even specific sections providing the driver a radius of light which leads them through their journey. We expect this service will be able to cut our energy consumption on roads in half but that’s not all, we also expect to be able to integrate intelligence into the system which will enables us to gather raw data on how our roads are being used and where necessary make adjustments for this.</p>



<p>Should the system detect that a car may have stopped along its path or had a crash, our system will be able to detect this and communicate with the appropriate emergency services that an incident has happened, not only will this increase safety but also aid in returning the traffic to a smooth flow on our roads.</p>



<p>We expect that our system will be able to be retrofitted into the current services already available on roads today and take advantage of the current lighting infrastructure, maintaining low instillation costs. The service will also take advantage of pre-existing infrastructure such as local telephone towers, satellites, and other services to create a net of communications between road users and lighting.</p>



<p>Not only will our Smart system lower power consumption and reducing carbon emissions but by association it will also reduce government expenditure allowing funds to be spent more meaningfully on other government initiatives.</p>



<h4>Motivation</h4>



<p>The concerns of global warming are broad and severe with many harsh impacts “Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history” All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have occurred since 2000. (Macmillan, 2016). Macmillan also identifies the cause of global warming being that it is the collection of Co2 and other greenhouse gasses collecting in the atmosphere and trapping solar radiation within it. Our primary motivation for this project is to take one of the most power consuming government initiatives and transform it into an environmentally friendly version. We obviously cannot eliminate street lighting entirely and reducing the strength of light as this would increases risk to society, however, our intelligent system will severely reduce energy consumption and the greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere, assisting in the fight against global warming. Not only will our system reduce power consumption, but it is possible we can eliminate it entirely with reduced energy usage it may be possible to affix solar panels to streetlights and abolish energy consumption of street lighting. The impact of this also results in huge savings for society either reducing taxes or allowing the government to reinvest the savings more efficiently.</p>



<h4>Landscape</h4>



<p>The landscape of street lighting in Australia has seen limited development in recent years, there are currently projects underway run by the IPWEA which aim to roll out new LED lighting to assist in reducing costs. The project aims to “reduce energy consumption by 30-70%+ and dramatic 50%+ reductions in maintenance costs” (IPWEA, 2019). We want to continue this development, our project will not require new lights to be installed as we will be building on the existing lighting infrastructure, rather we will be developing a software which intelligently</p>



<p>communicates with mobile devices and similar modules which can be fitted to cars for this purpose.</p>



<p>Our major competitor will be the SLSC project mentioned earlier, they have developed a system that has been rolled out before. The SLSC have a lot more experience and a better reputation than we do ourselves, the main point of difference for our project is that we have developed a system for manufacturing these devices extremely cheaply which does not require connection to a central mainframe, Rather the data stored by the devices will be able to pulled upon the regular maintenance of the lighting. The impact of this is lower costs however this restriction results in less capacity to assess live data from the lights.</p>

<h3>Aims&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The aim of this project is to develop a fully automated street lighting system to be used on major highways. This system would have the ability to identify a vehicle or vehicles location, adjust the lighting intensity accordingly for that area and remain on for a set distance in-front of the vehicle. It will reduce the&nbsp;total&nbsp;amount of time&nbsp;a light fitting will be on for thus reducing the running costs of the light and also reduce the total amount of light pollution emitted by the fitting.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Goals&nbsp;</h4>



<p>1,&nbsp;Software&nbsp;coding:&nbsp;The software&nbsp;code&nbsp;will need to be capable of&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;information of&nbsp;surrounding&nbsp;ambient light,&nbsp;approaching vehicles,&nbsp;GPS tracking satellites, have the ability to read RFID tags, have the ability to communicate with other fittings within a local area and&nbsp;have the ability to be overridden at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2,&nbsp;Firmware:&nbsp;Firmware design and construction will be based on the software program. It will need to have the ability to receive information from various sources and to have switching outputs for the hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3,&nbsp;Hardware:&nbsp;The hardware&nbsp;design and construction must have the&nbsp;capability&nbsp;of&nbsp;being installed&nbsp;into the restricted areas of existing light fittings as the project must have the ability to be retrofitted. The hardware will need to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;switch&nbsp;a&nbsp;240 Volt&nbsp;AC supply,&nbsp;from a controlled input&nbsp;via the firmware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4,&nbsp;Production and installation:&nbsp;A&nbsp;limited number of the hardware will be produced and installed into test fittings this is to enable testing of the product in various weather conditions, testing by a sample public and resolving any bug issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5, Mass production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goals are set out in order of priority as any of the following goals cannot be achieved without completion of the previous goal.&nbsp;The most important part of the project is the software&nbsp;coding. The&nbsp;code&nbsp;and software&nbsp;design&nbsp;will be the most technical&nbsp;part of the project and when completed,&nbsp;would be considered to be&nbsp;proprietary software.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Plans and Progress&nbsp;</h3>



<h4>Background</h4>



<p>When driving on the highway&nbsp;it was&nbsp;wondered why highway lighting was&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;so far in the distance, especially when driving away from or to a populated area.&nbsp;Noticing that,&nbsp;the&nbsp;further&nbsp;away you get from&nbsp;a populated&nbsp;area,&nbsp;motorway&nbsp;lighting&nbsp;became non-existent.&nbsp;Of course,&nbsp;this&nbsp;was due to&nbsp;cost and&nbsp;requirements, the&nbsp;nearer you get to a city your speed is reduced, there is more of a&nbsp;build-up&nbsp;of&nbsp;traffic and turn offs need to be highlighted for a safe exit. Naturally the&nbsp;further&nbsp;you drive away from a city, your speed can increase, there is less traffic around you and turn offs may be&nbsp;3,4, or 5,&nbsp;maybe more kilometers down the road. The need for street lighting in these areas are not required so much as these lengths of road are&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;safer to drive on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So,&nbsp;street lighting is needed the nearer we get to a city, but if nobody is on the road&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;there is no need for the&nbsp;streetlights&nbsp;to be&nbsp;‘on’,&nbsp;and the further away we get from the city,&nbsp;streetlights are&nbsp;required even less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The need to have a streetlight&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;at 2:00 AM when there is nobody on the road seems pointless and&nbsp;with&nbsp;the cost to run that light is&nbsp;being&nbsp;wasted. With the electrical cost to run&nbsp;one&nbsp;streetlight&nbsp;at&nbsp;about $200.00 per year&nbsp;with&nbsp;an average of&nbsp;the light being&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;for&nbsp;12 hours a day.&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Ergon Energy Forecast Expenditure Summary, Street Lighting Services 2015 to 2020)</em>&nbsp;state that their&nbsp;existing major street lighting asset base is a total of 48,763 units, if this is multiplied by the running cost of a light, the total cost&nbsp;of power to run the lights&nbsp;is in the region of $9,752,600 per year. Having lamps only come&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;for&nbsp;only&nbsp;half that time&nbsp;could save in the region of&nbsp;$4,876,300 per year.&nbsp;Ergon Energy.<em>&nbsp;</em>With installation of&nbsp;energy efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lighting&nbsp;technology, this cost could be reduced even further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;is how&nbsp;and why&nbsp;this&nbsp;project began.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What the project will do</h4>



<p>The project will&nbsp;have the capability to&nbsp;enable a&nbsp;streetlight&nbsp;to function as an independent item and not as part of&nbsp;a bank of lights. It will&nbsp;be able to detect&nbsp;when a vehicle has passed a&nbsp;certain&nbsp;point on the road&nbsp;and if the&nbsp;light will need to be switched&nbsp;‘on’. It will also be able to detect&nbsp;when&nbsp;a&nbsp;vehicle has passed&nbsp;a certain&nbsp;point&nbsp;which it will then&nbsp;switch&nbsp;‘off’.&nbsp;The switching&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;and&nbsp;‘off’&nbsp;will have the effect of creating a light corridor that the vehicle will be traveling in. The light itself would be able to communicate with the neighbouring light&nbsp;/ lights&nbsp;to inform&nbsp;them&nbsp;that there is a vehicle approaching&nbsp;and to ‘hand&nbsp;over’ its&nbsp;knowledge. When this is completed and the vehicle has passed&nbsp;certain&nbsp;point,&nbsp;the light will dim to&nbsp;an&nbsp;‘off’&nbsp;status. The quantity of lights that would communicate with each other will depend on the speed of the vehicle, the faster the vehicle&nbsp;is going&nbsp;the more lights&nbsp;to be turned&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;in front of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How will it be done</h4>



<p>The advantage of this project is that all&nbsp;streetlights&nbsp;would be able to be retrofitted with the&nbsp;technology and&nbsp;equipment required&nbsp;to make them become a smart light. I consider the equipment required would be a&nbsp;sensor&nbsp;to detect and register&nbsp;the&nbsp;speed&nbsp;of the vehicle, hardware for switching. The technology required&nbsp;will be for the&nbsp;communication&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;between the smart light&nbsp;and&nbsp;the ‘hand over’ of the&nbsp;light’s&nbsp;knowledge, with each luminaire having its own unique data address.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mode of communication on a new installation will be CAT 7 cable as the information being transferred along the line would be minimal.&nbsp;With the&nbsp;speed of data transfer not&nbsp;being&nbsp;an issue, fiber optic cable will not be required. On fittings that are to be retro-fitted, Wi-Fi communication equipment&nbsp;would&nbsp;need&nbsp;to be installed.&nbsp;A&nbsp;method of Power Line Communication&nbsp;(PLC)&nbsp;will need&nbsp;to be investigated as a means of redundancy for the system.&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Cypress Semiconductor, 2011).</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Stage of the Project</h4>



<p>The project so far is in the&nbsp;Project Initiation&nbsp;stage&nbsp;and will need to have a feasibility study&nbsp;to be&nbsp;completed to see if it is a viable case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Changes to the Project</h4>



<p>Changes to the initial project are&nbsp;to be&nbsp;an additional part of the project. The project&nbsp;will now need to include the capability for the smart lights to remain&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;if there has been an accident, this will enable the emergency crews to work safely in that area. Emergency vehicles&nbsp;will need&nbsp;to have the ability to automatically override lights to&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;when on route to an emergency&nbsp;and will need to be fitted with an RFID type tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this,&nbsp;the technology&nbsp;to be installed within the lights&nbsp;will need to have the&nbsp;capability&nbsp;to receive information from an RFID tag, identify if the tag holder is on an emergency call and to adjust the state of the lights&nbsp;accordingly&nbsp;and&nbsp;it would&nbsp;also be able to remain&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;until such a time that&nbsp;the&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;state is no longer required.&nbsp;Inclusion of a light monitoring system to monitor lamp failure, loss of power,&nbsp;communications failure and system diagnostic.&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure</em><em>)</em><em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Remaining Work</h4>



<p>An application will need to be sent to the government to apply for a&nbsp;Community Energy Efficiency Program&nbsp;(CEEP) grant.&nbsp;LED lamp colour&nbsp;to be confirmed with local governments,&nbsp;as&nbsp;white in the colour range of 3500K to 5000K (Kelvin) is&nbsp;found to be&nbsp;better than sodium lights&nbsp;which are&nbsp;in the 3000K range.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>(Street lighting n.d.)</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Expected Results</h4>



<p>Upon completion of this project&nbsp;the public would be able to see a noticeable reduction in light pollution, governments will have a greater cost saving in the running and maintenance of highway lighting with the&nbsp;savings&nbsp;being filtered down to&nbsp;the general public.&nbsp;The response time for the emergency services will reduce as the smart lighting will act as a&nbsp;guidance and&nbsp;light corridor for the emergency services.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Roles&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The project requires specific roles to ensure successful completion. The following roles are essential to this project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Software Designer;</em>&nbsp;Required to design and create the program for the controlling of the smart lights. The software designer collaborates with other IT specialists to deliver the software solution for the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Project Manager</em>;&nbsp;Required to manage the project, including resourcing specific skilled personnel to complete the project. A project manager is essential to ensure milestones and goals are achieved delivering the project on time and within budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Hardware Engineer</em>;&nbsp;Required for the installation and testing component of the project, including inspections and completing modifications that may be required. The hardware engineer will ensure all components meet the standards required.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Programmer</em>;&nbsp;Required to write the specific code for this project, enabling the smart lights to communicate. Coding is crucial for the project’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Lead Developer</em>; Required for the responsibility of the overall planning and execution of the project. The lead developer will be the navigator of the team&nbsp;and to ensure&nbsp;all team members are on the same page.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Scopes and Limits</h3>



<p>The main goal of the project is to reduce costs spent on lighting each year. We hope to reduce by half, which will total in millions of dollars if you count the number of street lights in each state. One aim that will come with it is reduction of light pollution, which is blamed for “compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments”[1]. If a vehicle has stopped at an unusual place, for example in the middle of the freeway, the GPS or some other sensors could have a “look” and if it is an accident or some other reason, it could alert the emergency services and keep the lights on until the freeway is completely cleared.</p>



<p>What we are NOT planning on implementing is doing a hardware upgrade. Rather than inserting sensors that track vehicles directly into the lights, which will take many hours and money to accomplish, we are only doing a software upgrade that uses existing technology such as cameras and GPS to accomplish the task. This will further reduce the costs of implementation. Another attractive idea that would be useful but we are not planning on adding is the for the opposite reason – such as if a criminal is speeding on the freeway, the lights, when they sense how fast he or she is driving, will deliberately turn off to make it harder for that person to run away. The person would be forced to slow down or crash.</p>



<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>



<h4>Software required for the project would be</h4>



<p>&#8211; A programming language, most likely C/C++ or Java, and its compiler/interpreter. Examples include the GNU Compiler&nbsp;Collection(GCC) for C/C++ or the Oracle Java SE Development Kit for Java. We are not sure which language to implement the service in. We will need it to program the hardware we will be installing in each light to sense cars driving close by.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; If one is available, probably a software simulator of streetlights will be useful for testing purposes too. We could apply the software controlling the lights and sensors into the emulation and we could observe the effects and fix and improve any issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Although highly unlikely, we may need a low-level hardware descriptor language like Verilog or VHDL for the electronic engineer to design the chips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A software license may be required for a streetlight simulator.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Hardware required for the project:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&#8211; A streetlight for experimentation so we can try installing the new sensors in it, and checking it to see of it works, and trying to find bugs and errors in the code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Soldering irons,&nbsp;perfboards/stripboards/breadboards, resistors, diodes,&nbsp;capactitors, and various other small electronic parts and tools for the electronic engineer to make a prototype of and to test the sensor hardware which will go on the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; 3D printers will be a nice tool to have, but not necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; We will need sensors – motion sensors, light sensors, and cameras so that the lights have a good perspective of where the car is.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>People on the team who have experience with the tools and technologies described:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&#8211; Michael has experience and a working knowledge of programming in C, C++ and Java with his interest in low-level computer programming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; As Colin is an electrician, he may have some experience in designing circuits and could possibly help in designing and implementing the sensors in the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Brendan has experience with light coding, developing robots and using a 3D printer which can be helpful. He got all this experience from personal interest.</p>



<h3>&nbsp;Testing</h3>



<p>The testing process will be over several stages and&nbsp;with&nbsp;different aspects of the project. Initially all&nbsp;testing&nbsp;will be completed in the&nbsp;mock-up&nbsp;stage, this&nbsp;being the&nbsp;testing&nbsp;of&nbsp;the software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The software testing will be,&nbsp;programming of the communication protocols,&nbsp;vehicle and speed detectors, configuring of the&nbsp;RFID detectors, on and off timers, contactor&nbsp;controllers, switching&nbsp;and the Wi-Fi protocol.&nbsp;This will&nbsp;then&nbsp;become the firmware for the lights. The&nbsp;next stage will be to&nbsp;join items with this firmware together to create a string. The string will then need to be programmed&nbsp;so as to follow the rules of switching,&nbsp;A&nbsp;set quantity of lights&nbsp;will be required to switch ‘on’&nbsp;depending on speed of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vehicle&nbsp;also,&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;override to&nbsp;the&nbsp;‘on’ state&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;RFID transmitter is detected (emergency stage) and to switch&nbsp;‘off’&nbsp;previous lights in the string. This stage will be considered successful if&nbsp;the&nbsp;lights&nbsp;can be switched&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;by means of a passing object&nbsp;or&nbsp;triggered&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;by a RFID transmitter.&nbsp;This stage of the testing will also be part of the&nbsp;feasibility study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next test will be to install the firmware and hardware into&nbsp;several interconnecting streetlights over a&nbsp;track&nbsp;to confirm that the firmware and&nbsp;protocols&nbsp;are able to function under real life&nbsp;conditions. This&nbsp;will comprise of driving past the lights to see how they respond&nbsp;and testing in different weather conditions to confirm Wi-Fi communication.&nbsp;The final stage of testing will be to have members of the general public, drive pass the lights several times in the evening&nbsp;to see if they are ‘user friendly’. A report will be compiled from feedback to a questionnaire completed by the public involved in this test.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Timeframe</h2>



<p> </p>



<p>For the first week, we will need to get everyone to be familiar with the project. Every member will have to read up the necessary materials and tools needed for this project. Weekly group meetings are going to be essential to be able to review the project as it is getting structured and be able to address any problems moving forward. For this for the second week, we will be analysing the tools and technologies needed for this project. We will also go over software and hardware requirements then make preparations for the coming development weeks. For development and design, we will make a 3-week timeline for this. With much preparation and knowledge, I think that we will be able to progress and make a working project in that timeframe. 7th week will be all testing and maintenance.

<h3>Risks</h3>



<p>The risks which may arise within the project could be,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Software&nbsp;incompatibility with the hardware,&nbsp;there&nbsp;will be various hardware sensors installed within the fitting,&nbsp;using&nbsp;their&nbsp;own protocols which the software code will need to understand and act upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cost, the end cost of the item may be at such a level that it will not be a variable product to install into the fittings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Public perception, the general public may feel the product has a safety issue with the lights not being on all the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hacking, the product may be able to be hacked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scope creep, the need to add more functions to the software from the original concept.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Group Processes and Communications.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The main form of communication for the group will be Microsoft Teams, this tool enables members to upload or download reports, and includes the ability to message either a single member or the group. The frequency of meetings will be a minimum of twice a week at the start of the project, increasing to three or four times a week nearing the completion date,&nbsp;if appropriate or required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a group member is not responding to communication via Microsoft Teams, direct emails will be used as another form of communication&nbsp;to encourage group participation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To bring the idea of automated street lighting to reality, I need to assemble a team of 4 experienced individuals. Each person would have the following skills, experience and degrees/certifications:</p>



<h3>Programmers</h3>



<p>I would probably have one experienced programmer on my team. He/she would need a lot of experience with various languages but especially Python and Java, as those languages are big players in the programming industry[1]. They will need to have a good understanding of how the GPS service works and have written a software that used the service before. A degree in IT or computer science is essential. The person will write the software that tracks vehicles and switch on the light accordingly. They will need to make sure that the new software will go well with the existing software that manages the lights.</p>



<h3>Cybersecurity technician</h3>



<p>We will need one person who have a degree in cybersecurity or something similar. That person needs to have a good knowledge of the language the programmers used to implement the service, and they will be responsible for testing and probing the programmers’ code, making sure that they are secure to the highest standards so that it will be harder for attackers to break into and control the lights. He/she will also be responsible for ensuring that it work flawlessly and it does not contain mistakes or bugs.</p>



<h3>Marketer</h3>



<p>Last but not least, we will need someone to advertise and tell the world that Melbourne now has automated street lighting. He or she will be the person the news, magazines and other companies will interview. The marketer will need to have a good understanding of how the system works and if issues raise with the system, the manager will need to research it and report it to the rest of the team. He or she will need a degree in marketing, and have been involved in a large-scale project affecting the community before.</p>



<h3>Electronic engineer</h3>



<p>We will need a certified electrician or hardware designer to design and implement the hardware we will install into our lights. A degree in electronic engineering is mandatory. Experience with designing computer chips, programming them and embedding them into existing technology will be very useful. The engineer will work closely with the programmer, making sure that the hardware that will be designed, will work with the computer languages the programmers intend to use, and to make sure that it will blend smoothly into the existing infrastructure.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Overall, the team worked out above average. We continued to use Microsoft Teams, which was a very good online communication tool that served our purpose well. It also acted as our file sharing tool, which was very useful for sharing files and giving and receiving feedback. One thing that went well was how simple and quick it was to communicate. It was very easy to share files that was all located together in one place.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;some group members rarely communicated on the platform and one or two did not contribute at all, so there were more work for the members who were present. Another issue was that since it was very common for members to work at different times so that when one member writes something, then later goes offline, then another member shows up, dislikes what the other one wrote then updates it. The original member comes back&nbsp;later&nbsp;and he is like, “Oh, what happened to my text?”. We could have organised a frequent meeting so that we could have a good talk&nbsp;with every member of the team to discuss&nbsp;who is responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;what, and&nbsp;provide others with feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time around our team was much more organised in the beginning, one of our team members segmented each section of the assignment allocating a percentage of the total report for each task. This method of organising our individual workloads assisted us in ensuring a fair share of the work to be done and has made it easier to reflect on how&nbsp;each individual&nbsp;assisted the group. With this implemented our communications were set to a minimum, much less that in assessment number 2 with communications being limited to asking for help, clarification, or uploading our sections. This is both good and bad, it allowed us to get along with our jobs and become much more efficient, however, it also meant that we weren&#8217;t bouncing ideas&nbsp;off of&nbsp;each other potentially missing out on a&nbsp;broader&nbsp;range of ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The one thing that is learnt about groups, and especially in this situation we were in, being unable to communicate to each other face to face and to create bonds, is that, most of the times it is not an issue. A group can still function without the need to see each other&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;organised&nbsp;from the start. With this group a process was implemented in completing this assessment and even though there was a couple of little hiccups along the way, the process and assessment was completed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Comments on Audit Trail</h3>



<p>This time around we were all already familiar with the format that we were going to use, considering Microsoft teams (MS&nbsp;teams) worked so well in the last assessment we decided to use it again. Before anyone commenced&nbsp;work&nbsp;Collin segmented the individual sections to be complete for assessment and allocated percentage points for each of them, we then all had a look over the document and come to an agreement on these percentage allocations. We used this document to self-allocate the sections which most interested us individually and were able to take advantage&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;MS&nbsp;teams live cloud based word documents to ensure there was no overlap with expectations. From this point onward there was minimal contact, much less than we had last time, because we all knew our roles and expectations within the group, I think this worked well and allowed everyone to get on with their tasks. We did keep in contact with a couple of posts per week from each individual, most of&nbsp;these conversation&nbsp;were to; clarify data, seek approval, cooperate on sections, and confirm compliance with the criteria. I was surprised how smoothly everything ran this time, there were a couple of tasks which needed to be reallocated due to lifestyle or work changes which were posted in the group and almost immediately someone picked them up. Our audit trail in Microsoft teams should depict an organised, well managed team with all members chipping in to help complete the task. Unfortunately the same two members who didn’t make an effort in out last assessment still never showed in this one, however, we managed to get everything done none the less.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
