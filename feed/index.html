<h2> That Team’s ideal jobs </h2>



<p>Embedded Software engineer</p>



<p>Level 3 Senior Network Specialist</p>



<p>Financial Data Analyst</p>



<p>Cyber Security, Technology Risk and Compliance Manager</p>



<h4> How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>



<p> According to Job insights from Burning Glass Technologies, Software engineer ranks 11th in top job titles. Software engineers will continue to be in high demand. According to Cyberstates 2018, there are 1.4 million software and web developers-which is the largest and fastest growing category of tech jobs. Cyber security jobs are also in high demand due to lack of cyber security professionals. It is estimated that by 2020, there will be a global shortfall of over 1.5 million cyber security professionals. Almost 20% of positions in Australia will go unfilled because of a lack of trained professionals. The need for quality cyber security experts worldwide is clear. Although Data Analyst is not on the top titles, business intelligence analysis and data analysis professionals are looking to be in the highest demand from employers in the future. It was reported in Computerworld the growth in AI, data science, and big data analytics has created 2.7 million new jobs forecasted globally by 2020.</p>



<h4> From your group&#8217;s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group&#8217;s required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (JavaScript, SQL, etc) </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://BrendanDRMIT.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/table.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81" srcset="http://BrendanDRMIT.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/table.png 730w, http://BrendanDRMIT.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/table-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></figure>



<h4> How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>



<p> According to Labour insights provided by Burning Glass, Programming languages like JAVA and C# are in the top 12 of IT Skills that are in greatest demand from employers. Strong knowledge of operating systems like Windows and Linux are also in demand from employers. Git was also regarded as an in-demand skills to have as an IT professional. Although CCNA/CCNP was not included, I do think having one of these certifications will be highly regarded for network/cyber security jobs. </p>



<h4> How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>



<p> Communications skills is still the top general skill to have when it comes to employers. Having high level verbal and written communication skills are essential in any workplace. From a business standpoint, all transactions result from communication. Teamwork, problem solving, and analytical skills are also regarded as skills that are in great demand. </p>



<h4>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h4>



<p>SQL</p>



<p>JavaScript</p>



<p>Project Management</p>



<h4> What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </h4>



<p>Organisational Skills</p>



<p>Writing</p>



<p>Planning</p>



<h4> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h4>



<p>

No, because my Ideal job of Cybersecurity Professional is looking to be one of the highest in-demand jobs in the future. There are a lot of current job insights that are predicting the demand from employers. Even today, there is a high demand but short supply of Cyber Security professionals.

<h2> Overview</h2>



<p> The project idea combines a passion for finance and I.T. to develop a program which allows the individual to easily create an investment portfolio which maximises their profitability whilst minimising risk for the individual. The program will use historic data from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and apply statistical analysis to create an individual profile for each investment option, on top of this we will be experimenting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to maximise efficiency and accuracy of outputs. The user will have complete control of their portfolio and receive live updated through a phone app which will notify them when their investments reach certain benchmarks of their portfolio goes outside of parameters. </p>



<h2> Motivation</h2>



<p> Investing is a very confusing and nerve-racking experience for someone who has never done it before, and it can often be very daunting for people, many not knowing where to start and as such spend hours upon hour researching where to best invest their money. Ultimately the decisions these people make are commonly the wrong ones for their circumstances resulting in an individual taking on more risk or having limited access to liquid funds. This program aims to fix these common issues by profiling the individual into risk profiles through means of a questionnaire. </p>



<h2> Description</h2>



<p>Upon signing up the user will be asked a series of questions based around their lifestyle, financial positions, goals etc. The answers to these questions will then profile the individual and create a dummy portfolio which outlines an ideal asset allocation for their position based on different asset classes (Stock, Bonds, property, cash). For example, someone who needs fast access to their cash will be recommended to hold a high percentage of their portfolio in cash or term deposits whereas someone who has a lot of disposable income or less of a need for liquidity will be recommended towards a higher percentage of stock or bonds. The individual will be able to alter their ideal portfolio if they disagree with the initial response from the programme, this allows for full control.</p>



<p>Once the user has set up their profile the programme will start recommending investments to build the users portfolio based on the asset allocations determined. Users will be able to access all securities available on the Australian Stock Exchange, however, the programme will have a built-in algorithm to determine their best choices. The user will be able to buy and sell the stock with a built-in, online broker program.</p>



<p>The underlying programme will pull data, in real time, directly from the Australian Stock Exchange, all data and charts commonly available will be displayed, however, an algorithm will assess data from the last 10 years to determine the standard deviation and based off of this a likely range (1, 2, and 3 standard deviations). Other information may be available based off of the AI component of the algorithm.</p>



<p> Once the user has set up their profile, they will be able to set up weekly or monthly payments into their account to help them budget for their investments. Each month the AI will suggest investment options based on their portfolio preference and the likely outcome of the investment. </p>



<p>With the large fluctuations of economic markets, it is easy for an individual’s portfolio to become unbalanced and this is why our project will involve updates and phone notifications to the user. Once an individual’s asset allocations move outside a certain range, the individual will be alerted that their profile has become too “Bullish” or too “Bearish” and recommend buying or selling stock based of rebalancing their portfolio.</p>



<p>A final AI component will be available, should the user wish to use it; this will give the program authority to buy and sell stock based off of indicators which would indicate to the computer that a stock is either going to crash of skyrocket, this could allow for instant gratification of small indicators which an individual might miss should they need to approve a trade. The user will also be able to set certain “sell points” for their stock to mitigate potential losses.</p>



<p>This program will allow people to live their daily lives without having to constantly check their booking app to see how their stock is doing or investing countless hours researching investment options.</p>



<h2> Technical Requirements </h2>



<p>In order to make this project work, we are going to need a number of IT and Finance professionals. A website professional will help us set up an efficiently running website with appropriate sales funnels and linking to the Australian Stock Exchange data, we will also need a highly secured database to store personal and account information. Finance professionals will be required along with an AI professional to assist in programming the algorithm which will assess stock and assist the user with their investment choices </p>

<h2> What does it do </h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p> Machine learning in the past started with basic pattern recognition allowing computers to be programmed to perform specific tasks. But as the interesting of artificial intelligence grew programmers wanted to see if computers could learn from data already stored on them. Machine learning of today is so different from machine learning in the past, today as computers are exposed to new data, they can independently adapt to that new information. They can learn from any previous computations to produce reliable decision&#8217;s and results. With today’s learning algorithms it is the ability to complete complex calculations with a small amount of data rather than a large amount of data and the ability to complete these calculations repeatedly, and faster and faster. With machine learning the ability for computer to produce a result from multiple sources of data it is being fed, this enables the machine to make quick decisions and produce a reliable outcome, it enables autonomous cars to be able to sense the area around them and to react accordingly. [2] </p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p> Many industries today that accumulate large amounts of data can use machine learning to enable them to work more efficiently and to gain an advantage over their competitors. Financial institutes can identify investment opportunities to prevent fraud and help investors, it is also used for cyber security and to identify potential fraud. With healthcare the amount of data received from wearable devices and sensors enables Healthcare professionals to analyse this data to help with diagnosing and treatment for patients. Within the retail industry, machine learning can analyse a customer’s buying history, and with this specific data it is able to make targeted advertising to the customer for a more personalised shopping experience for the customer. And with the transportation industry, patterns can be identified with usage, popularity of certain routes, peak periods. This enables them to make more reliable and cost-effective routes. [1] </p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> I consider over the next few years more and more businesses will use machine learning as part of their daily business. With machine learning becoming more and more common, I consider there will be new companies starting up, specifically in programming algorithms for businesses and for artificial intelligence. Medicine and biology will increasingly be using machine learning applications as this technology becomes more and more sophisticated, CT and MRI scans will be able to be analysed by machine learning programs and to aid the medical profession and scientists in identifying any disease or problems sooner. [3] I feel that with medicine there will be more surgery procedures performed by robots with 100% accuracy. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p>  The development that make possible machine learning is a above all data. The more the data that is supplied for the algorithm the more accurate the predictions will be. The development and introduction of learning methods has greatly helped with machine learning. The two main learning methods are, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. With supervised learning a large amount of labelled data is fed to the algorithm where a desired output is known, the algorithm learns by comparing the actual output with the desired output and then modifies the model to produce the desired output. With unsupervised learning, algorithms are given data that has no labels. With this learning algorithms identify patterns within the data that have similarities with each other, enabling the data to be categorised. With the development of other learning sets (Semi-supervised learning and Reinforcement learning), machine learning has become more accurate. </p>



<h2> What is the likely impact </h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p> One likely change is the way we may not be using currency. With machine learning you be able to walk into a store, pick up any items you require and walk out without the need to use your credit card, all with the aid of facial recognition. The way we Interact with technology will change, no longer will we switch on the TV just watch a program, we will start to talk to the TV and start having a conversation with it. </p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p>I feel that most people if not all people will be affected by machine learning in one way or another. As machine learning gets integrated more and more into daily lives, with smart phones, smart TV’s etc, we will become more and more reliant with what machine learning has to offer. The effect will be minimal, but the result will be positive. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p>With the growth of machine learning, I consider it would create many job opportunities. I consider a new job market will be created for data collection, this may be though people answering questionnaires in the street to web designers, designing a web-based questionnaire.</p>



<p>Major chip designers and small start-up companies are now designing and creating processing chips that are specifically designed for machine learning i.e. Googles Tensor Processing Unit.</p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<h4>  In your daily life, how will this affect you?  </h4>



<p> The effect that machine learning will have on my daily life, I consider to be a double-edged sword. On one hand I would have the convenience of speed, if I order an item then I know I could have it delivered within the same day with autonomous drones. If I want to go on holiday all I need to do is just tell the car where I want to go and let the car take me there, without the worry of having work out a route. But I feel that all the advantages machine language has to offer, it could make me lazier and less able to think for myself. </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p>I feel that there will be no one thing that will be different for me, at the moment. Understanding that machine learning is becoming more and more part of my daily life and understanding the advantages that machine learning has with-in my life. Also knowing that machine learning runs in the background and it is only the end result that I can see, this may make a difference in the way I feel about a cashless, card less sociality that is driven around by autonomous cars. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p> The effect machine learning will have on family and friends is understanding what machine learning does. There may be a bit of fear, and a bit of scepticism, but overall, I don&#8217;t consider this will affect them. The older members of my family may embrace the convenience that machine learning has to offer, especially in the medical field where their illnesses can be diagnosed with a better accuracy. With the younger generation of my family, machine learning is already part of their daily lives and to them it may be just another one of them things that they are completely innocent and unaware in how much it is an impact on their daily lives. </p>

<h2>What Does It Do </h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p>Blockchains and cryptocurrencies were once thought of as a single unit, both coming hand in hand. But now they have evolved as two separate units. Blockchain allows for information to be distributed and as it is not being able to be copied, it was originally devised for digital currency Bitcoin etc. Blockchains is a time-stamped record of data that is unable to be changed and is managed by multiple computers, not owned by a single establishment. Blockchain is made from two parts, blocks of data ‘Block’ and the tying to each other by using cryptography ‘Chain’.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency is a way to use blockchains to transfer money from one party to another without having to go through a financial institution. By this method there is no transaction fees as one cryptocurrency coin sent is the same value as one cryptocurrency coin received irrespective of it is sent within the same country or across the globe.</p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p>Cryptocurrency is much the same as paper money. Cryptocurrency can be traded on exchange markets where the value of the currency can either go up or down. The currency can be bought with cash from ATM around the globe as well as individual traders. The currency is also accepted as cash from many company’s both small traders to major company’s including Wikipedia, Microsoft and Expedia (with some limitations). Virgin Galactic will allow you to pay for a space travel with Bitcoins. You can store your currency the same way as you store your money in your wallet but with different methods. An electronic wallet, where you store your private encryption</p>



<p>keys on your computer, in the cloud or on a software wallet. A hardware wallet which is where you store your keys on an item like a flash drive and even a paper wallet where your private, public keys and the bitcoin address can be printed on paper and stored.</p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> There is much confused with blockchain as it is perceived to be tied in with cryptocurrency, but as blockchain is an item by itself it needs to distance itself from cryptocurrency. A misunderstood problem with blockchain is its slow performance, which, due to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, gives blockchain a falsely perceived negative look. Blockchains are more than just a carrier for cryptocurrency, I feel that It needs to expand on the solutions that has for numerous industries. Cryptocurrency needs to be part of today&#8217;s economic system for it to grow But that may not be possible as Bitcoin has a limited number of ‘coins’ that can be mined And when mining has stopped the scenario is that there will be not enough computer power needed to assure transactions. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p>Blockchain have many technical challenges that it needs to overcome to be a ‘program in its own right’. It would need to provide similar foundation technologies as those of the Internet, Financial institutes like banks would also need to adopt blockchain which is an issue with the financial institute’s and not with the technology itself. block chains communication protocol will also need to change like HTTP and have a language such as HTML. This will enable the content of blockchain to be more user friendly. There needs to be a common communication protocol for the blockchains as existing blockchains are independent and are unable to interact with</p>



<p>each other. But above all blockchains needs to have regulations and support from international governments and institutions for it to succeed in today’s market. For cryptocurrency to succeed it would need to be part of the mainstream financial system. The algorithms that is used by cryptocurrency will need to be more complex to avoid any fraud or hacking, but also the same time be easy for people to understand what cryptocurrency is and what it can do. Safeguards will be needed to put into place as well, for protection and anonymity of its users but also ensuring that it is not an easy way to launder money.</p>



<h2> What is the likely impact</h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<p> The potential impact that cryptocurrency can have is with the World currency market. At this moment of time, the existing global economy is controlled by the US dollar. With several government&#8217;s trying to end the reign of the US dollar, cryptocurrency could be well placed to replace the US dollar as a global currency. The impact of this development I feel, would have a far-reaching effect. </p>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p> Change I feel will affect the way we purchase items we used to purchase items with paper money, that change to now where we tend to pay for items with our credit cards or debit cards and with cryptocurrency this could be the next evolution in money. When travelling overseas the need to change money into foreign currency will no longer be required with the potential of exchange rates being a thing of the past. </p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p> I feel this type of technology would affect most if not all of the general public. The general public would have to understand how cryptocurrency works, they would have to understand what a virtual wallet was and how to use one. There will be a need to explain to public of any fears that they might have regarding security and hacking. I feel the effect the older generation may have regarding cryptocurrency is fear, the fear that their money would not physical and the fear that they may lose the money that they do have. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p> I don&#8217;t consider this will create many jobs if crypto currency is more widely used. As cryptocurrency itself is not a physical item the need for financial institutes to hold our money in safes will not be required. I can see that there will be a possible reduction of frontline staff in banks and with the potential of banks themselves in high streets slowly diminishing. Banks themselves may create a cloud for its customers to deposit any cryptocurrency into with the safeguard against theft and hacking, and because of this, I consider financial institutes would employ more IT professionals to safeguard customers currency. </p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<h4> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </h4>



<p>I consider the effect of cryptocurrency in my daily life to be very minimal, like the majority of people paper money is not used as much as it used to be as now any transactions or purchases, are mostly made on the credit card or debit card. Even when purchasing items on the web the credit card is the main form of transferring money. With crypto currency being potentially another form of credit card the use of it I consider would be the same as using an existing credit card. I feel though that I may have more of a concern with the security regarding the cryptocurrency, this may affect my spending habits and how I&#8217;m making transactions. </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p> If cryptocurrency became part of the mainstream financial system, I feel that it would make no difference to me personally. Like any other currency, Singapore Dollar, German Euro or the United States Dollar, the cryptocurrency to me would be a currency that, if required, I would purchase. As these currencies are not part of my everyday life, having a cryptocurrency become part of the global market this also would not be part of my everyday life. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p> The effect it may have on members of my family or friends I feel would very much depend on there age. Younger members of my family or friends, may find that dealing with a cryptocurrency and blockchains will become part of there normal day. I feel that as cryptocurrency has a future in online games and especially blockchain as a means for an online game to reward a player for playing their game, the younger generation will think of this as a norm. Older members may be sceptical about Blockchains and especially cryptocurrency, maybe having a fear of the unknown.</p>

<h2><br>What does it do?</h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p> The Raspberry Pi is a minicomputer, the size of a credit card. It is a highly popular computer for creating, playing, programming and hacking, mainly because of its minimal price tag of $50AUD. The latest version is the Pi 4, which features two HDMI outputs! It contains a state of the art 64-bit ARM CPU clocked at 1.5GHZ, up to four gigabyte RAM and USB 3.0 for speedy data bandwidth. It contains 40 general purpose input/output which can be connected to virtually anything from motors to robots to other computers. An Ethernet port is bundled for Internet connectivity. Power is supplied by a USB-C port. </p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p> It is mostly used to create ingenious inventions that make life easier. For example, Dave Akerman blew up a balloon and tied a Raspberry Pi onto it and sent it to space. He took photos of the solar system and of the world that are now famous. His website [1]. Another example of a cool idea with the Pi is to connect it to a water pump, which you can then control when to spray water onto your garden, so you don’t have to do it yourself. It is particularly useful when going away from home for a long time, but don’t want your plants to die. A tutorial is available [2]. One of the best things about it is that it consumes very little power, so people often build clusters of Pis that work together to complete a task faster than a single Pi. One common use of it is to use it for a server, or as an IOT device. </p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> One of the things we will be able to do soon, when the Pi increases in processing power and decreases in size, is to play modern video games at a playable frame rate! Some people already have ditched their bulky x86-based CPU PCs in favour of the tiny computer, which we will see a lot more soon. Because nobody likes bulky computers, right? People might start embedding them in TVs and computer monitors so all you really need is the monitor! The increased processing power, and RAM will be useful for many things, which include using it as a server to host a website. I personally have done this myself. But in three years, the Pi might be powerful enough to host and maintain a game online, something similar to Agar.io [3]! I envision 300, maybe 500 Pis working together to render scenes for a game – maybe for VR or on an 8K TV – at 200+ frames per second. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p> I am going to discuss about the Pi clusters. Obviously, the hardware specifications are what makes all of the ideas possible. Although one of the developments that contribute is the speed of the internet. The most popular way to distribute tasks to each node – each Pi – is through the internet, so speed, especially latency (how fast each node responds) is important if you want to ensure speedy completion of a task. There need to be another computer to distribute tasks to each node, or you can use one of the nodes to do it. There are simple Python libraries that will accomplish this task. </p>



<h2> <em>What is the likely impact </em></h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<p> The potential impact of this development is huge. Computers will still get smaller and faster and consume less and less energy. Soon big, old black PC boxes will become a legend and something that few people remember. Another impact the Pi have made on our world is that it encourages us to tinker, program and hack, leading to children getting interested in programming, which is extremely important in a world that is covered in computers. Soon coding will be a necessary skill for each child and will be included in school curriculum all around the world. </p>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p> With the Pi, task automation is a perk that is very useful. Soon we won’t need to even get out of our bed. The Raspberry Pi or some other minicomputer will tip our bed over so that we land on our feet. Then it will serve us our breakfast, stuffing the food in your face. After that, it will dress us. Brush our teeth. The list goes on – you get the idea. </p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p> In my opinion, the people most affected by the phenomenon described in the last paragraph will be those who have a disability – not being able to look after themselves. Tiny computers, and most likely AI, will make sure that those people lead a healthy and happy lives. People without a disability, however, can still benefit from these computers in many ways, which include entertainment, productivity, content creation, among others. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p> The future is fuzzy – it is really difficult to predict what will happen – but one thing definitely will happen is since computers are taking over the world, job demand will plummet. I will list some examples of jobs that will become redundant as computer application evolves. One is carpentry, as there are now 3-D printers big enough to create buildings. Those machines will still need to be set up by people, though. Another example is people who work with shops – managers, people who stock goods, etc. Robots will replace them. Jobs that doesn’t require people to come up with original ideas, activities, etc, that is impossible for computers to do, will become a demand. </p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<p> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </p>



<p> It will obviously affect my everyday life as I have described above. Computers will do all our work that doesn’t require original ideas. Imagine the robots from the film WALL-E but apply it to the world (although not everyone will be really fat, it wouldn’t be healthy). I wouldn’t really have to do anything. Jobs that require programming and making up ideas will be the norm, so I will most likely be on the computer for the rest of my life – telling the computer – verbally &#8211; my ideas, and then the computer will convert them to code, which it will then automatically send it to a server or something – I have no idea! </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p> Since I am deaf, instead of verbally talking to the computer, I will be signing in Auslan to the computer, which then translates to code. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p> The affect Raspberry Pi or any other small computing devices will have on my family and friends is the ability of having an affordable computer that is also extremely portable. The ability to be able to communicate and share an idea with family members would affect them greatly, especially with the open source software these devices run on. A minicomputer the size of a flash drive would help friends understand what I am thinking not just understanding what I am saying. </p>

<h2> What does it do?</h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p> I am going to discuss about robots that try to imitate human or animal movement. I would say that the company that makes the latest and up-to-date robots is US- based Boston Dynamics. They design, and manufacture robots that focuses on agility and strength. They make robots that imitate human and animals’ movements. Their robots are battery-powered, thus making it portable. Their robots utilise hydraulic technology to move their limbs. Their latest human-inspired robot, named Atlas, released in 2013, is so agile that it can perform a backflip, and can-do parkour! However, they were built for search and rescue tasks. The processor and memory is unknown, as requested by the US Defence Advanced Research Project Agency, who funded Boston Dynamics for the building of the robot. Atlas have undergone various updates since the initiation in 2013, the latest one showcasing Atlas doing a handstand! The company also recently launched a robot named Spot. It moves in a similar fashion to dogs and is used for assisting constructing buildings. It is only available for specialized construction industries to purchase and use. It is customizable, offering attachments that expand its functionality. </p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p> Boston Dynamics’ robots are capable of moving on rough terrain, which is handy for the construction industry and for the military. They can, using AI, detect hazards on the path they are walking in, and avert them by removing them or if unable to do so, walking around it. Their agility is so stable that even if you kick them or push them hard, as numerous people have done on YouTube videos, they will keep their ground and not tip over. Their robots are able to open doors and let people through, carry things of various shapes and sizes and have inbuilt cameras all over their bodies so that they can be remote controlled as well as wandering on their own.</p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> One of Dynamics’ robots, Spot, is being distributed to construction industries and in hope that it will assist them with dangerous tasks such as checking for an oil or gas leak. One of the issues with it is that it still cannot distinguish between soft and hard floor, such as a pile of dirt or cement. Thus, it is not stable and performs poorly in certain conditions. So, the answer to the question what it will be likely to do soon is it hopefully will be much more stable. Another issue is the small battery – it runs for one and half hours, then will need to be replaced. As AI evolves, robots will get smarter and avoid potential hazards and solve problems that could baffle humans. I don’t think they will be available to the general public for the next three years, or even ten, but the day when all of us have our own personal robot with AI is coming – soon. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p> Boston Dynamics have been rather quiet about the specifications of their robots because their sponsors asked them to, but their robots use hydraulic powered joints to ensure that they can lift heavy weights. All of the robots’ chassis are 3-d printed to ensure that they remain lightweight and sturdy, not breaking when they fall over. Of course, AI and machine learning is a necessity for the robots to seem more humanlike. Scientists and engineers at Boston train the machines every day, as machine learning do their jobs of discovering how physics work. They need to upgrade the memory in the robots frequently with every software update which teaches the robots how to do more and more things. </p>



<h2> What is the likely impact </h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<p> The potential impact for this development is at the moment small. The robots are too expensive and unreliable, huge and heavy. They were designed with special tasks that is dangerous or even fatal for humans to do – such as helping the injured in a disaster where there are fire, gas or other dangers. However, Boston have programmed its Spot robot to be able to dance, so they can also be used for entertainment! With the help of Spot, which can carry up to 14kg, carpenters will complete buildings much faster and efficiently. </p>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p>A list of what is likely to change, if Spot is sold to all construction companies:</p>



<p>1. Buildings will be completed faster. This also means that lots of carpenters and other people who work in the construction industry will lost their jobs.</p>



<p>2. The number of deaths from accidents while building buildings will reduce dramatically.</p>



<p>3. Spot was built with inspection in mind, so humans who are tired, sick or distracted, etc won’t be able to properly inspect buildings for dangerous situations, thus the robot can hopefully find and eliminate more dangers than humans.</p>



<p>4. In future upgrades, Spot will gain more functionality, maybe the ability to place brick and mortar and other muscle jobs, so it is likely that in the near future there won’t be any people at the construction site – only robots, remote controlled by humans far away!</p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p> The people most affected, naturally, will be those who work in the construction industry – by losing their jobs, as with many other muscle jobs that future robots will replace soon. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p> Jobs that will become redundant like I mentioned above are carpenters. Technologies that will become redundant include various instruments that test wood, brick, wires, etc for faults because they will be embedded in robots. </p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<h4> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </h4>



<p> The evolution of robots that assist with constructing buildings won’t really affect my daily life, except for if a construction is going on nearby, as I walk or ride past, I will see a nest of robots working together, which is probably a little creepy. But if Boston programmed their robots to be able to fix motorbikes, then I would be out of a job, as I come to my local motorbike mechanic and clean up for the mechanics. </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p> I have always dreamt of building my own house. But if robots did it for you, it would take away all the fun from building something original that really belong to you. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p>

As I have many friends who are tradesmen, when robots replace them, they will very likely lose their jobs and forced to work at McDonalds’ or something. They may even become homeless. They will be forced to pick an alternate route to gain a good income, one that may include undertaking a course to gain knowledge for a different job.

<p> Interview conducted 1st October 2019 with IT Professional (Darren)</p>



<p><em><strong>What type of work is done by the IT professional?</strong></em></p>



<p>The type of work that is done by Darren consists of, installation of computer hardware, software and maintenance. When possible, with most of the software installation and updating this is completed remotely to try to minimise site visits. He is also involved in network and telephone patching as well as backup support.</p>



<p><strong><em>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with?</em></strong></p>



<p>The people Darren interacts with are various stakeholders ranging from the administration staff to managers, but most of the interactions are with other IT professional colleagues that are within his team, including the local area IT manager with most of the interaction consisting of knowledge base sharing.</p>



<p>Every now and again Darren will complete a site visit and have a formal one to one interaction with the client but where possible this is done by either a telephone conversation, email, Skype or remote connections with their computer.</p>



<p><strong><em>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</em></strong></p>



<p>Darren spends most of his time within the IT department office, as the majority of his workload can be completed via remote access to his client’s hardware were, he is able to correct most of the client’s issues.</p>



<p><strong><em>What aspect of their position is the most challenging?</em></strong></p>



<p>Darren finds the most challenging part of the job is with coordination with other IT teams. Were he is having to coordinate and complete a job request from other IT teams only to find out that the other IT teams may have not completed their part of the assigned job within the allotted time.</p>
