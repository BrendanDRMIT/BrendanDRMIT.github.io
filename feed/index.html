<h4>Topic</h4>



<p>The existing running cost for a streetlight is $0.21195/KWh, (Ergon Energy), with each motorway lamp being about 250 Watts, the electrical running cost per lamp is in the region of $232 per year, and on a suburban street this equates to about $88.00 per year this is with a 95-Watt lamp.</p>



<p>On a length of motorway there are about 22 streetlights per kilometre of road, whereas in suburban streets there are about 28 streetlamps per kilometre (Energyrating.gov). The resulting lighting cost to the government is estimated at $5104 and $2464 respectively, per year per kilometre of lit road. Although there are initiatives currently underway within the industry, specifically the Street Lighting Smart Controls program (SLSC) governed by the Institute of Public Works Engineering Australia (IPWEA), we don’t think that this is enough. These initiatives are majorly concerned with rolling out new LED lighting in streetlamps and too reduce costs with a lesser focus on the intelligent integration of the use of these streetlamps within society. The focus needs to be on the intelligent integration of communications devices to assist in the development of an intelligent system which not only reduces the environmental impact of our street lighting have, but also to improve the safety of drivers, and emergency services.</p>



<p>In this day and age communications devices make up so much of our day to day life and more importantly for our project, our driving experiences. Whether you’re following Google Maps on your way home, streaming music from Spotify, or on the phone with your loved ones; all of these services use some sort of frequency which</p>



<p>we can track and use to predict your actions. The primary use of our service would be to take advantage of live GPS updates and signals from streaming services or telephone towers from one’s communications devices to predict their movements along a path and pre-emptively light their way. This method of lighting will enable us to light only the roads which are under use and even specific sections providing the driver a radius of light which leads them through their journey. We expect this service will be able to cut our energy consumption on roads in half but that’s not all, we also expect to be able to integrate intelligence into the system which will enables us to gather raw data on how our roads are being used and where necessary make adjustments for this.</p>



<p>Should the system detect that a car may have stopped along its path or had a crash, our system will be able to detect this and communicate with the appropriate emergency services that an incident has happened, not only will this increase safety but also aid in returning the traffic to a smooth flow on our roads.</p>



<p>We expect that our system will be able to be retrofitted into the current services already available on roads today and take advantage of the current lighting infrastructure, maintaining low instillation costs. The service will also take advantage of pre-existing infrastructure such as local telephone towers, satellites, and other services to create a net of communications between road users and lighting.</p>



<p>Not only will our Smart system lower power consumption and reducing carbon emissions but by association it will also reduce government expenditure allowing funds to be spent more meaningfully on other government initiatives.</p>



<h4>Motivation</h4>



<p>The concerns of global warming are broad and severe with many harsh impacts “Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history” All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have occurred since 2000. (Macmillan, 2016). Macmillan also identifies the cause of global warming being that it is the collection of Co2 and other greenhouse gasses collecting in the atmosphere and trapping solar radiation within it. Our primary motivation for this project is to take one of the most power consuming government initiatives and transform it into an environmentally friendly version. We obviously cannot eliminate street lighting entirely and reducing the strength of light as this would increases risk to society, however, our intelligent system will severely reduce energy consumption and the greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere, assisting in the fight against global warming. Not only will our system reduce power consumption, but it is possible we can eliminate it entirely with reduced energy usage it may be possible to affix solar panels to streetlights and abolish energy consumption of street lighting. The impact of this also results in huge savings for society either reducing taxes or allowing the government to reinvest the savings more efficiently.</p>



<h4>Landscape</h4>



<p>The landscape of street lighting in Australia has seen limited development in recent years, there are currently projects underway run by the IPWEA which aim to roll out new LED lighting to assist in reducing costs. The project aims to “reduce energy consumption by 30-70%+ and dramatic 50%+ reductions in maintenance costs” (IPWEA, 2019). We want to continue this development, our project will not require new lights to be installed as we will be building on the existing lighting infrastructure, rather we will be developing a software which intelligently</p>



<p>communicates with mobile devices and similar modules which can be fitted to cars for this purpose.</p>



<p>Our major competitor will be the SLSC project mentioned earlier, they have developed a system that has been rolled out before. The SLSC have a lot more experience and a better reputation than we do ourselves, the main point of difference for our project is that we have developed a system for manufacturing these devices extremely cheaply which does not require connection to a central mainframe, Rather the data stored by the devices will be able to pulled upon the regular maintenance of the lighting. The impact of this is lower costs however this restriction results in less capacity to assess live data from the lights.</p>

<h3>Aims&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The aim of this project is to develop a fully automated street lighting system to be used on major highways. This system would have the ability to identify a vehicle or vehicles location, adjust the lighting intensity accordingly for that area and remain on for a set distance in-front of the vehicle. It will reduce the&nbsp;total&nbsp;amount of time&nbsp;a light fitting will be on for thus reducing the running costs of the light and also reduce the total amount of light pollution emitted by the fitting.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Goals&nbsp;</h4>



<p>1,&nbsp;Software&nbsp;coding:&nbsp;The software&nbsp;code&nbsp;will need to be capable of&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;information of&nbsp;surrounding&nbsp;ambient light,&nbsp;approaching vehicles,&nbsp;GPS tracking satellites, have the ability to read RFID tags, have the ability to communicate with other fittings within a local area and&nbsp;have the ability to be overridden at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2,&nbsp;Firmware:&nbsp;Firmware design and construction will be based on the software program. It will need to have the ability to receive information from various sources and to have switching outputs for the hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3,&nbsp;Hardware:&nbsp;The hardware&nbsp;design and construction must have the&nbsp;capability&nbsp;of&nbsp;being installed&nbsp;into the restricted areas of existing light fittings as the project must have the ability to be retrofitted. The hardware will need to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;switch&nbsp;a&nbsp;240 Volt&nbsp;AC supply,&nbsp;from a controlled input&nbsp;via the firmware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4,&nbsp;Production and installation:&nbsp;A&nbsp;limited number of the hardware will be produced and installed into test fittings this is to enable testing of the product in various weather conditions, testing by a sample public and resolving any bug issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5, Mass production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goals are set out in order of priority as any of the following goals cannot be achieved without completion of the previous goal.&nbsp;The most important part of the project is the software&nbsp;coding. The&nbsp;code&nbsp;and software&nbsp;design&nbsp;will be the most technical&nbsp;part of the project and when completed,&nbsp;would be considered to be&nbsp;proprietary software.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Plans and Progress&nbsp;</h3>



<h4>Background</h4>



<p>When driving on the highway&nbsp;it was&nbsp;wondered why highway lighting was&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;so far in the distance, especially when driving away from or to a populated area.&nbsp;Noticing that,&nbsp;the&nbsp;further&nbsp;away you get from&nbsp;a populated&nbsp;area,&nbsp;motorway&nbsp;lighting&nbsp;became non-existent.&nbsp;Of course,&nbsp;this&nbsp;was due to&nbsp;cost and&nbsp;requirements, the&nbsp;nearer you get to a city your speed is reduced, there is more of a&nbsp;build-up&nbsp;of&nbsp;traffic and turn offs need to be highlighted for a safe exit. Naturally the&nbsp;further&nbsp;you drive away from a city, your speed can increase, there is less traffic around you and turn offs may be&nbsp;3,4, or 5,&nbsp;maybe more kilometers down the road. The need for street lighting in these areas are not required so much as these lengths of road are&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;safer to drive on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So,&nbsp;street lighting is needed the nearer we get to a city, but if nobody is on the road&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;there is no need for the&nbsp;streetlights&nbsp;to be&nbsp;‘on’,&nbsp;and the further away we get from the city,&nbsp;streetlights are&nbsp;required even less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The need to have a streetlight&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;at 2:00 AM when there is nobody on the road seems pointless and&nbsp;with&nbsp;the cost to run that light is&nbsp;being&nbsp;wasted. With the electrical cost to run&nbsp;one&nbsp;streetlight&nbsp;at&nbsp;about $200.00 per year&nbsp;with&nbsp;an average of&nbsp;the light being&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;for&nbsp;12 hours a day.&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Ergon Energy Forecast Expenditure Summary, Street Lighting Services 2015 to 2020)</em>&nbsp;state that their&nbsp;existing major street lighting asset base is a total of 48,763 units, if this is multiplied by the running cost of a light, the total cost&nbsp;of power to run the lights&nbsp;is in the region of $9,752,600 per year. Having lamps only come&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;for&nbsp;only&nbsp;half that time&nbsp;could save in the region of&nbsp;$4,876,300 per year.&nbsp;Ergon Energy.<em>&nbsp;</em>With installation of&nbsp;energy efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lighting&nbsp;technology, this cost could be reduced even further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;is how&nbsp;and why&nbsp;this&nbsp;project began.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>What the project will do</h4>



<p>The project will&nbsp;have the capability to&nbsp;enable a&nbsp;streetlight&nbsp;to function as an independent item and not as part of&nbsp;a bank of lights. It will&nbsp;be able to detect&nbsp;when a vehicle has passed a&nbsp;certain&nbsp;point on the road&nbsp;and if the&nbsp;light will need to be switched&nbsp;‘on’. It will also be able to detect&nbsp;when&nbsp;a&nbsp;vehicle has passed&nbsp;a certain&nbsp;point&nbsp;which it will then&nbsp;switch&nbsp;‘off’.&nbsp;The switching&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;and&nbsp;‘off’&nbsp;will have the effect of creating a light corridor that the vehicle will be traveling in. The light itself would be able to communicate with the neighbouring light&nbsp;/ lights&nbsp;to inform&nbsp;them&nbsp;that there is a vehicle approaching&nbsp;and to ‘hand&nbsp;over’ its&nbsp;knowledge. When this is completed and the vehicle has passed&nbsp;certain&nbsp;point,&nbsp;the light will dim to&nbsp;an&nbsp;‘off’&nbsp;status. The quantity of lights that would communicate with each other will depend on the speed of the vehicle, the faster the vehicle&nbsp;is going&nbsp;the more lights&nbsp;to be turned&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;in front of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How will it be done</h4>



<p>The advantage of this project is that all&nbsp;streetlights&nbsp;would be able to be retrofitted with the&nbsp;technology and&nbsp;equipment required&nbsp;to make them become a smart light. I consider the equipment required would be a&nbsp;sensor&nbsp;to detect and register&nbsp;the&nbsp;speed&nbsp;of the vehicle, hardware for switching. The technology required&nbsp;will be for the&nbsp;communication&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;between the smart light&nbsp;and&nbsp;the ‘hand over’ of the&nbsp;light’s&nbsp;knowledge, with each luminaire having its own unique data address.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mode of communication on a new installation will be CAT 7 cable as the information being transferred along the line would be minimal.&nbsp;With the&nbsp;speed of data transfer not&nbsp;being&nbsp;an issue, fiber optic cable will not be required. On fittings that are to be retro-fitted, Wi-Fi communication equipment&nbsp;would&nbsp;need&nbsp;to be installed.&nbsp;A&nbsp;method of Power Line Communication&nbsp;(PLC)&nbsp;will need&nbsp;to be investigated as a means of redundancy for the system.&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Cypress Semiconductor, 2011).</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Stage of the Project</h4>



<p>The project so far is in the&nbsp;Project Initiation&nbsp;stage&nbsp;and will need to have a feasibility study&nbsp;to be&nbsp;completed to see if it is a viable case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Changes to the Project</h4>



<p>Changes to the initial project are&nbsp;to be&nbsp;an additional part of the project. The project&nbsp;will now need to include the capability for the smart lights to remain&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;if there has been an accident, this will enable the emergency crews to work safely in that area. Emergency vehicles&nbsp;will need&nbsp;to have the ability to automatically override lights to&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;when on route to an emergency&nbsp;and will need to be fitted with an RFID type tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this,&nbsp;the technology&nbsp;to be installed within the lights&nbsp;will need to have the&nbsp;capability&nbsp;to receive information from an RFID tag, identify if the tag holder is on an emergency call and to adjust the state of the lights&nbsp;accordingly&nbsp;and&nbsp;it would&nbsp;also be able to remain&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;until such a time that&nbsp;the&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;state is no longer required.&nbsp;Inclusion of a light monitoring system to monitor lamp failure, loss of power,&nbsp;communications failure and system diagnostic.&nbsp;<em>(</em><em>Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure</em><em>)</em><em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Remaining Work</h4>



<p>An application will need to be sent to the government to apply for a&nbsp;Community Energy Efficiency Program&nbsp;(CEEP) grant.&nbsp;LED lamp colour&nbsp;to be confirmed with local governments,&nbsp;as&nbsp;white in the colour range of 3500K to 5000K (Kelvin) is&nbsp;found to be&nbsp;better than sodium lights&nbsp;which are&nbsp;in the 3000K range.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>(Street lighting n.d.)</em>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Expected Results</h4>



<p>Upon completion of this project&nbsp;the public would be able to see a noticeable reduction in light pollution, governments will have a greater cost saving in the running and maintenance of highway lighting with the&nbsp;savings&nbsp;being filtered down to&nbsp;the general public.&nbsp;The response time for the emergency services will reduce as the smart lighting will act as a&nbsp;guidance and&nbsp;light corridor for the emergency services.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Roles&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The project requires specific roles to ensure successful completion. The following roles are essential to this project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Software Designer;</em>&nbsp;Required to design and create the program for the controlling of the smart lights. The software designer collaborates with other IT specialists to deliver the software solution for the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Project Manager</em>;&nbsp;Required to manage the project, including resourcing specific skilled personnel to complete the project. A project manager is essential to ensure milestones and goals are achieved delivering the project on time and within budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Hardware Engineer</em>;&nbsp;Required for the installation and testing component of the project, including inspections and completing modifications that may be required. The hardware engineer will ensure all components meet the standards required.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Programmer</em>;&nbsp;Required to write the specific code for this project, enabling the smart lights to communicate. Coding is crucial for the project’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Lead Developer</em>; Required for the responsibility of the overall planning and execution of the project. The lead developer will be the navigator of the team&nbsp;and to ensure&nbsp;all team members are on the same page.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Scopes and Limits</h3>



<p>The main goal of the project is to reduce costs spent on lighting each year. We hope to reduce by half, which will total in millions of dollars if you count the number of street lights in each state. One aim that will come with it is reduction of light pollution, which is blamed for “compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments”[1]. If a vehicle has stopped at an unusual place, for example in the middle of the freeway, the GPS or some other sensors could have a “look” and if it is an accident or some other reason, it could alert the emergency services and keep the lights on until the freeway is completely cleared.</p>



<p>What we are NOT planning on implementing is doing a hardware upgrade. Rather than inserting sensors that track vehicles directly into the lights, which will take many hours and money to accomplish, we are only doing a software upgrade that uses existing technology such as cameras and GPS to accomplish the task. This will further reduce the costs of implementation. Another attractive idea that would be useful but we are not planning on adding is the for the opposite reason – such as if a criminal is speeding on the freeway, the lights, when they sense how fast he or she is driving, will deliberately turn off to make it harder for that person to run away. The person would be forced to slow down or crash.</p>



<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>



<h4>Software required for the project would be</h4>



<p>&#8211; A programming language, most likely C/C++ or Java, and its compiler/interpreter. Examples include the GNU Compiler&nbsp;Collection(GCC) for C/C++ or the Oracle Java SE Development Kit for Java. We are not sure which language to implement the service in. We will need it to program the hardware we will be installing in each light to sense cars driving close by.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; If one is available, probably a software simulator of streetlights will be useful for testing purposes too. We could apply the software controlling the lights and sensors into the emulation and we could observe the effects and fix and improve any issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Although highly unlikely, we may need a low-level hardware descriptor language like Verilog or VHDL for the electronic engineer to design the chips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A software license may be required for a streetlight simulator.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Hardware required for the project:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&#8211; A streetlight for experimentation so we can try installing the new sensors in it, and checking it to see of it works, and trying to find bugs and errors in the code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Soldering irons,&nbsp;perfboards/stripboards/breadboards, resistors, diodes,&nbsp;capactitors, and various other small electronic parts and tools for the electronic engineer to make a prototype of and to test the sensor hardware which will go on the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; 3D printers will be a nice tool to have, but not necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; We will need sensors – motion sensors, light sensors, and cameras so that the lights have a good perspective of where the car is.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>People on the team who have experience with the tools and technologies described:&nbsp;</h4>



<p>&#8211; Michael has experience and a working knowledge of programming in C, C++ and Java with his interest in low-level computer programming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; As Colin is an electrician, he may have some experience in designing circuits and could possibly help in designing and implementing the sensors in the lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Brendan has experience with light coding, developing robots and using a 3D printer which can be helpful. He got all this experience from personal interest.</p>



<h3>&nbsp;Testing</h3>



<p>The testing process will be over several stages and&nbsp;with&nbsp;different aspects of the project. Initially all&nbsp;testing&nbsp;will be completed in the&nbsp;mock-up&nbsp;stage, this&nbsp;being the&nbsp;testing&nbsp;of&nbsp;the software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The software testing will be,&nbsp;programming of the communication protocols,&nbsp;vehicle and speed detectors, configuring of the&nbsp;RFID detectors, on and off timers, contactor&nbsp;controllers, switching&nbsp;and the Wi-Fi protocol.&nbsp;This will&nbsp;then&nbsp;become the firmware for the lights. The&nbsp;next stage will be to&nbsp;join items with this firmware together to create a string. The string will then need to be programmed&nbsp;so as to follow the rules of switching,&nbsp;A&nbsp;set quantity of lights&nbsp;will be required to switch ‘on’&nbsp;depending on speed of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vehicle&nbsp;also,&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;override to&nbsp;the&nbsp;‘on’ state&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;RFID transmitter is detected (emergency stage) and to switch&nbsp;‘off’&nbsp;previous lights in the string. This stage will be considered successful if&nbsp;the&nbsp;lights&nbsp;can be switched&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;by means of a passing object&nbsp;or&nbsp;triggered&nbsp;‘on’&nbsp;by a RFID transmitter.&nbsp;This stage of the testing will also be part of the&nbsp;feasibility study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next test will be to install the firmware and hardware into&nbsp;several interconnecting streetlights over a&nbsp;track&nbsp;to confirm that the firmware and&nbsp;protocols&nbsp;are able to function under real life&nbsp;conditions. This&nbsp;will comprise of driving past the lights to see how they respond&nbsp;and testing in different weather conditions to confirm Wi-Fi communication.&nbsp;The final stage of testing will be to have members of the general public, drive pass the lights several times in the evening&nbsp;to see if they are ‘user friendly’. A report will be compiled from feedback to a questionnaire completed by the public involved in this test.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Timeframe</h2>



<p> </p>



<p>For the first week, we will need to get everyone to be familiar with the project. Every member will have to read up the necessary materials and tools needed for this project. Weekly group meetings are going to be essential to be able to review the project as it is getting structured and be able to address any problems moving forward. For this for the second week, we will be analysing the tools and technologies needed for this project. We will also go over software and hardware requirements then make preparations for the coming development weeks. For development and design, we will make a 3-week timeline for this. With much preparation and knowledge, I think that we will be able to progress and make a working project in that timeframe. 7th week will be all testing and maintenance. We will make sure the project is working properly, assessing any errors and bugs if there are any, and address any functionality issues. For the last week, we will make our final report and documentation of the project. </p>

<h3>Risks</h3>



<p>The risks which may arise within the project could be,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Software&nbsp;incompatibility with the hardware,&nbsp;there&nbsp;will be various hardware sensors installed within the fitting,&nbsp;using&nbsp;their&nbsp;own protocols which the software code will need to understand and act upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cost, the end cost of the item may be at such a level that it will not be a variable product to install into the fittings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Public perception, the general public may feel the product has a safety issue with the lights not being on all the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hacking, the product may be able to be hacked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scope creep, the need to add more functions to the software from the original concept.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Group Processes and Communications.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The main form of communication for the group will be Microsoft Teams, this tool enables members to upload or download reports, and includes the ability to message either a single member or the group. The frequency of meetings will be a minimum of twice a week at the start of the project, increasing to three or four times a week nearing the completion date,&nbsp;if appropriate or required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a group member is not responding to communication via Microsoft Teams, direct emails will be used as another form of communication&nbsp;to encourage group participation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To bring the idea of automated street lighting to reality, I need to assemble a team of 4 experienced individuals. Each person would have the following skills, experience and degrees/certifications:</p>



<h3>Programmers</h3>



<p>I would probably have one experienced programmer on my team. He/she would need a lot of experience with various languages but especially Python and Java, as those languages are big players in the programming industry[1]. They will need to have a good understanding of how the GPS service works and have written a software that used the service before. A degree in IT or computer science is essential. The person will write the software that tracks vehicles and switch on the light accordingly. They will need to make sure that the new software will go well with the existing software that manages the lights.</p>



<h3>Cybersecurity technician</h3>



<p>We will need one person who have a degree in cybersecurity or something similar. That person needs to have a good knowledge of the language the programmers used to implement the service, and they will be responsible for testing and probing the programmers’ code, making sure that they are secure to the highest standards so that it will be harder for attackers to break into and control the lights. He/she will also be responsible for ensuring that it work flawlessly and it does not contain mistakes or bugs.</p>



<h3>Marketer</h3>



<p>Last but not least, we will need someone to advertise and tell the world that Melbourne now has automated street lighting. He or she will be the person the news, magazines and other companies will interview. The marketer will need to have a good understanding of how the system works and if issues raise with the system, the manager will need to research it and report it to the rest of the team. He or she will need a degree in marketing, and have been involved in a large-scale project affecting the community before.</p>



<h3>Electronic engineer</h3>



<p>We will need a certified electrician or hardware designer to design and implement the hardware we will install into our lights. A degree in electronic engineering is mandatory. Experience with designing computer chips, programming them and embedding them into existing technology will be very useful. The engineer will work closely with the programmer, making sure that the hardware that will be designed, will work with the computer languages the programmers intend to use, and to make sure that it will blend smoothly into the existing infrastructure.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Overall, the team worked out above average. We continued to use Microsoft Teams, which was a very good online communication tool that served our purpose well. It also acted as our file sharing tool, which was very useful for sharing files and giving and receiving feedback. One thing that went well was how simple and quick it was to communicate. It was very easy to share files that was all located together in one place.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;some group members rarely communicated on the platform and one or two did not contribute at all, so there were more work for the members who were present. Another issue was that since it was very common for members to work at different times so that when one member writes something, then later goes offline, then another member shows up, dislikes what the other one wrote then updates it. The original member comes back&nbsp;later&nbsp;and he is like, “Oh, what happened to my text?”. We could have organised a frequent meeting so that we could have a good talk&nbsp;with every member of the team to discuss&nbsp;who is responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;what, and&nbsp;provide others with feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time around our team was much more organised in the beginning, one of our team members segmented each section of the assignment allocating a percentage of the total report for each task. This method of organising our individual workloads assisted us in ensuring a fair share of the work to be done and has made it easier to reflect on how&nbsp;each individual&nbsp;assisted the group. With this implemented our communications were set to a minimum, much less that in assessment number 2 with communications being limited to asking for help, clarification, or uploading our sections. This is both good and bad, it allowed us to get along with our jobs and become much more efficient, however, it also meant that we weren&#8217;t bouncing ideas&nbsp;off of&nbsp;each other potentially missing out on a&nbsp;broader&nbsp;range of ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The one thing that is learnt about groups, and especially in this situation we were in, being unable to communicate to each other face to face and to create bonds, is that, most of the times it is not an issue. A group can still function without the need to see each other&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;organised&nbsp;from the start. With this group a process was implemented in completing this assessment and even though there was a couple of little hiccups along the way, the process and assessment was completed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Comments on Audit Trail</h3>



<p>This time around we were all already familiar with the format that we were going to use, considering Microsoft teams (MS&nbsp;teams) worked so well in the last assessment we decided to use it again. Before anyone commenced&nbsp;work&nbsp;Collin segmented the individual sections to be complete for assessment and allocated percentage points for each of them, we then all had a look over the document and come to an agreement on these percentage allocations. We used this document to self-allocate the sections which most interested us individually and were able to take advantage&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;MS&nbsp;teams live cloud based word documents to ensure there was no overlap with expectations. From this point onward there was minimal contact, much less than we had last time, because we all knew our roles and expectations within the group, I think this worked well and allowed everyone to get on with their tasks. We did keep in contact with a couple of posts per week from each individual, most of&nbsp;these conversation&nbsp;were to; clarify data, seek approval, cooperate on sections, and confirm compliance with the criteria. I was surprised how smoothly everything ran this time, there were a couple of tasks which needed to be reallocated due to lifestyle or work changes which were posted in the group and almost immediately someone picked them up. Our audit trail in Microsoft teams should depict an organised, well managed team with all members chipping in to help complete the task. Unfortunately the same two members who didn’t make an effort in out last assessment still never showed in this one, however, we managed to get everything done none the less.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h2><strong>Group Reflection</strong></h2>



<h4><em>What went well?</em>&nbsp; </h4>



<p>The&nbsp;whole group performed well with this
assessment.&nbsp;There&nbsp;was communication between the team members and
ideas were encouraged. Having a word document within Microsoft Teams with tasks
to be completed, enabled everyone to modify and track which tasks needed to be
completed&nbsp;and&nbsp;have ownership&nbsp;of tasks that they completed.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><em>What could be
improved?</em>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The team itself, improved and bonded better over time,
getting to know each team members strength and knowledge was a plus for the
team but a better way to communicate between team members would be a great
improvement. Perhaps the use of&nbsp;Github&nbsp;as opposed to Microsoft teams
may have allowed for all team members to more easily access the service and
reduced the work required in generating logs for the assessment, and to gain
more knowledge and familiarity of Git.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><em>At least one
thing that was surprising?</em>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The&nbsp;surprising part of this group&nbsp;was&nbsp;the way
team members just&nbsp;assigned themselves&nbsp;a task and ran&nbsp;with it.
Communication between members&nbsp;was, at times,&nbsp;found to be
easy&nbsp;and helpful, at times finding it&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;easy&nbsp;to
have just a chat.&nbsp; I was surprised with the functionality of MS Teams and
how easy it made communications between team members as I had never used this
service before.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><em>At least one
thing you have learned about&nbsp;groups.</em>&nbsp; </h4>



<p>One thing that has been learnt about this group is
their&nbsp;willingness to contribute, knowing that each member wants to achieve
the best possible result for the&nbsp;group&nbsp;as a whole. A second thing
learnt would be how easily groups flow when there is a more systematic approach
and everyone knows what they should be doing, or what others are already doing.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><em>Tools.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The communication log between each member using Microsoft
Teams enabled everyone to see and check their assigned tasks and the progress
of other team members. This ensured that a task was not completed twice by
other members and that each member knew what the other members were completing.
We also used&nbsp;Wordpress&nbsp;to design and implement our website. All the
work uploaded to MS Teams were then ported to the website.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>



<h4>Colin Batiste</h4>



<p>My perception of the group has been positive. The progress of
the group at the start was slow as we were all trying to find our way around
things with Microsoft Teams, but once established, communication and
collaboration started to pick up between each of the group members. In the
short time that the group has been formed, discussions about the tasks have
been short but to the point and finding out what each group members strength is
has work well in assigned tasks and projects. I feel that I have performed well
for this assessment and that my contributed to the tasks will help this group
achieve a high score, and if we were to continue as a group for other tasks and
assessments the group itself would only improve. The one thing I have learned
from this group is that everyone works at their own pace, but all are focused
on achieving the same goal.</p>



<h4>Michael Souprounovich </h4>



<p>In my experience working with “That Team”, it was
particularly good. Everyone in the team was very helpful, sociable and did
their part. There weren’t any disagreements, fights etc. One bad thing about
our team was that one or two people didn’t work at all – they didn’t even show
up in our group discussion. I was surprised at how well we worked together; I
have always had a bad experience with teamwork. I was also surprised that
working in groups online is as good as face-to-face teamwork, as I have never
worked in a group that only met online. I learnt that groups aren’t always a
disaster zone, and that there are a multitude of very useful tools online that
make group collaboration a piece of cake. We used Microsoft Teams as our
communication platform. We were supposed to contribute to the website
individually, our team did things a bit differently and we chose one person in
our group to maintain the website, and everyone else just did all the writing
and the website maintainer just took it and formatted it for the website. This
was effective and we used WordPress to ensure that the construction of our
website was quick and simple.</p>

<h4>Rahnny Tajaran </h4>



<p>I think that one of the things that went well was having
someone that stepped up as a leader. This led to things getting organised and
someone who followed up on our group’s task. Also, one of our members were
quick to make up a website. I guess one of the things that could be improved
was the communication platform that we used. In all fairness, this was my first
time using that platform and was confused at first, but I quickly got used to
the features, so It was all fine. I think it would’ve been better if I quickly
got on to the tasks that I have chosen to do. I think this set the team a
little bit behind. Also, it would be a bit better if we voted first what kind
of platform, we are comfortable using although I have found MS teams to be
alright. One surprising thing was how well the team meshed together quickly.
Everyone had already chosen which task or part of the assignment they wanted to
do. I think I have learned that communication and teamwork are the two things
that will make any group succeed. By working together, we can find solutions
that works best. We were all working towards a common goal.</p>



<h4>Brendan Dilworth</h4>



<p>I feel like the team was organized fantastically, it was a
rocky start but once we had our Microsoft Teams set up it was super easy to
delegate tasks to each member and keep frequent communication. Roles were
easily identified and there was a clear leader who showed great management
skills keeping everybody on task. Microsoft teams allowed us to keep one word
document which updated live and limited having multiple copies of the same
document. Unfortunately we not all of the team members were able to connect by
Microsoft Teams which became out primary communications means, I feel like
having all team members in this group could have improved communications.
Knowing each others strengths and weaknesses moving forward I see improvement
for how we delegate tasks to play to each others strengths. I am genuinely
surprised how smoothly things ran once we got them together, most teams members
worked hard and seemed keen to get the work done. I learned that there needs to
be a clear management role in order to organise the group into sections and
delegate tasks. Secondly I Learnt that with the appropriate means for
communication and file management groups can become much more efficient.
Microsoft Teams allowed us to manage files, communicate between team members
and delegate tasks easily whilst keeping a communications log for all team
members to see. Our Github log activity only reflects work that has been done
on the website as we used an alternative service (MS Teams) for the rest of our
group organisation, however, I do believe that logs from MS teams should
accurately reflect the work being done for this group assignment.</p>

<h2> That Team’s ideal jobs </h2>



<p>Embedded Software engineer</p>



<p>Level 3 Senior Network Specialist</p>



<p>Financial Data Analyst</p>



<p>Cyber Security, Technology Risk and Compliance Manager</p>



<h4> How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>



<p>According to Job insights from Burning Glass Technologies, Software engineer ranks 11<sup>th</sup> in top job titles. Software engineers will continue to be in high demand. According to Cyberstates 2018, there are 1.4 million software and web developers-which is the largest and fastest growing category of tech jobs. Cyber security jobs are also in high demand due to lack of cyber security professionals. It is estimated that by 2020, there will be a global shortfall of over 1.5 million cyber security professionals. Almost 20% of positions in Australia will go unfilled because of a lack of trained professionals. The need for quality cyber security experts worldwide is clear. Although Data Analyst is not on the top titles, business intelligence analysis and data analysis professionals are looking to be in the highest demand from employers in the future. It was reported in <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/634495/data-scientist-drought-down-under/">Computerworld</a> the growth in AI, data science, and big data analytics has created 2.7 million new jobs forecasted globally by 2020. </p>



<h4> From your group&#8217;s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group&#8217;s required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (JavaScript, SQL, etc) </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://BrendanDRMIT.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/table.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81" srcset="http://BrendanDRMIT.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/table.png 730w, http://BrendanDRMIT.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/table-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></figure>



<h4> How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>



<p>According to Labour insights provided by Burning Glass, Programming languages like JAVA and C# are in the top 12 of IT Skills that are in greatest demand from employers. Strong knowledge of operating systems like Windows and Linux are also in demand from employers. Git was also regarded as an in-demand skills to have as an IT professional. Although CCNA/CCNP was not included, I do think having one of these certifications will be highly regarded for network/cyber security jobs. </p>



<h4> How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h4>



<p>Communications skills is still the top general skill to have when it comes to employers. Having high level verbal and written communication skills are essential in any workplace. From a business standpoint, all transactions result from communication. Teamwork, problem solving, and analytical skills are also regarded as skills that are in great demand. </p>



<h4>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h4>



<p>SQL</p>

<h2> Overview</h2>



<p> The project idea combines a passion for finance and I.T. to develop a program which allows the individual to easily create an investment portfolio which maximises their profitability whilst minimising risk for the individual. The program will use historic data from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and apply statistical analysis to create an individual profile for each investment option, on top of this we will be experimenting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to maximise efficiency and accuracy of outputs. The user will have complete control of their portfolio and receive live updated through a phone app which will notify them when their investments reach certain benchmarks of their portfolio goes outside of parameters. </p>



<h2> Motivation</h2>



<p> Investing is a very confusing and nerve-racking experience for someone who has never done it before, and it can often be very daunting for people, many not knowing where to start and as such spend hours upon hour researching where to best invest their money. Ultimately the decisions these people make are commonly the wrong ones for their circumstances resulting in an individual taking on more risk or having limited access to liquid funds. This program aims to fix these common issues by profiling the individual into risk profiles through means of a questionnaire. </p>



<h2> Description</h2>



<p>Upon signing up the user will be asked a series of questions based around their lifestyle, financial positions, goals etc. The answers to these questions will then profile the individual and create a dummy portfolio which outlines an ideal asset allocation for their position based on different asset classes (Stock, Bonds, property, cash). For example, someone who needs fast access to their cash will be recommended to hold a high percentage of their portfolio in cash or term deposits whereas someone who has a lot of disposable income or less of a need for liquidity will be recommended towards a higher percentage of stock or bonds. The individual will be able to alter their ideal portfolio if they disagree with the initial response from the programme, this allows for full control.</p>



<p>Once the user has set up their profile the programme will start recommending investments to build the users portfolio based on the asset allocations determined. Users will be able to access all securities available on the Australian Stock Exchange, however, the programme will have a built-in algorithm to determine their best choices. The user will be able to buy and sell the stock with a built-in, online broker program.</p>



<p>The underlying programme will pull data, in real time, directly from the Australian Stock Exchange, all data and charts commonly available will be displayed, however, an algorithm will assess data from the last 10 years to determine the standard deviation and based off of this a likely range (1, 2, and 3 standard deviations). Other information may be available based off of the AI component of the algorithm.</p>



<p> Once the user has set up their profile, they will be able to set up weekly or monthly payments into their account to help them budget for their investments. Each month the AI will suggest investment options based on their portfolio preference and the likely outcome of the investment. </p>



<p>With the large fluctuations of economic markets, it is easy for an individual’s portfolio to become unbalanced and this is why our project will involve updates and phone notifications to the user. Once an individual’s asset allocations move outside a certain range, the individual will be alerted that their profile has become too “Bullish” or too “Bearish” and recommend buying or selling stock based of rebalancing their portfolio.</p>



<p>A final AI component will be available, should the user wish to use it; this will give the program authority to buy and sell stock based off of indicators which would indicate to the computer that a stock is either going to crash of skyrocket, this could allow for instant gratification of small indicators which an individual might miss should they need to approve a trade. The user will also be able to set certain “sell points” for their stock to mitigate potential losses.</p>



<p>This program will allow people to live their daily lives without having to constantly check their booking app to see how their stock is doing or investing countless hours researching investment options.</p>



<h2> Technical Requirements </h2>



<p>In order to make this project work, we are going to need a number of IT and Finance professionals. A website professional will help us set up an efficiently running website with appropriate sales funnels and linking to the Australian Stock Exchange data, we will also need a highly secured database to store personal and account information. Finance professionals will be required along with an AI professional to assist in programming the algorithm which will assess stock and assist the user with their investment choices </p>

<h2> What does it do </h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p> Machine learning in the past started with basic pattern recognition allowing computers to be programmed to perform specific tasks. But as the interesting of artificial intelligence grew programmers wanted to see if computers could learn from data already stored on them. Machine learning of today is so different from machine learning in the past, today as computers are exposed to new data, they can independently adapt to that new information. They can learn from any previous computations to produce reliable decision&#8217;s and results. With today’s learning algorithms it is the ability to complete complex calculations with a small amount of data rather than a large amount of data and the ability to complete these calculations repeatedly, and faster and faster. With machine learning the ability for computer to produce a result from multiple sources of data it is being fed, this enables the machine to make quick decisions and produce a reliable outcome, it enables autonomous cars to be able to sense the area around them and to react accordingly. [2] </p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p> Many industries today that accumulate large amounts of data can use machine learning to enable them to work more efficiently and to gain an advantage over their competitors. Financial institutes can identify investment opportunities to prevent fraud and help investors, it is also used for cyber security and to identify potential fraud. With healthcare the amount of data received from wearable devices and sensors enables Healthcare professionals to analyse this data to help with diagnosing and treatment for patients. Within the retail industry, machine learning can analyse a customer’s buying history, and with this specific data it is able to make targeted advertising to the customer for a more personalised shopping experience for the customer. And with the transportation industry, patterns can be identified with usage, popularity of certain routes, peak periods. This enables them to make more reliable and cost-effective routes. [1] </p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> I consider over the next few years more and more businesses will use machine learning as part of their daily business. With machine learning becoming more and more common, I consider there will be new companies starting up, specifically in programming algorithms for businesses and for artificial intelligence. Medicine and biology will increasingly be using machine learning applications as this technology becomes more and more sophisticated, CT and MRI scans will be able to be analysed by machine learning programs and to aid the medical profession and scientists in identifying any disease or problems sooner. [3] I feel that with medicine there will be more surgery procedures performed by robots with 100% accuracy. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p>  The development that make possible machine learning is a above all data. The more the data that is supplied for the algorithm the more accurate the predictions will be. The development and introduction of learning methods has greatly helped with machine learning. The two main learning methods are, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. With supervised learning a large amount of labelled data is fed to the algorithm where a desired output is known, the algorithm learns by comparing the actual output with the desired output and then modifies the model to produce the desired output. With unsupervised learning, algorithms are given data that has no labels. With this learning algorithms identify patterns within the data that have similarities with each other, enabling the data to be categorised. With the development of other learning sets (Semi-supervised learning and Reinforcement learning), machine learning has become more accurate. </p>



<h2> What is the likely impact </h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p> One likely change is the way we may not be using currency. With machine learning you be able to walk into a store, pick up any items you require and walk out without the need to use your credit card, all with the aid of facial recognition. The way we Interact with technology will change, no longer will we switch on the TV just watch a program, we will start to talk to the TV and start having a conversation with it. </p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p>I feel that most people if not all people will be affected by machine learning in one way or another. As machine learning gets integrated more and more into daily lives, with smart phones, smart TV’s etc, we will become more and more reliant with what machine learning has to offer. The effect will be minimal, but the result will be positive. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p>With the growth of machine learning, I consider it would create many job opportunities. I consider a new job market will be created for data collection, this may be though people answering questionnaires in the street to web designers, designing a web-based questionnaire.</p>



<p>Major chip designers and small start-up companies are now designing and creating processing chips that are specifically designed for machine learning i.e. Googles Tensor Processing Unit.</p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<h4>  In your daily life, how will this affect you?  </h4>



<p> The effect that machine learning will have on my daily life, I consider to be a double-edged sword. On one hand I would have the convenience of speed, if I order an item then I know I could have it delivered within the same day with autonomous drones. If I want to go on holiday all I need to do is just tell the car where I want to go and let the car take me there, without the worry of having work out a route. But I feel that all the advantages machine language has to offer, it could make me lazier and less able to think for myself. </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p>I feel that there will be no one thing that will be different for me, at the moment. Understanding that machine learning is becoming more and more part of my daily life and understanding the advantages that machine learning has with-in my life. Also knowing that machine learning runs in the background and it is only the end result that I can see, this may make a difference in the way I feel about a cashless, card less sociality that is driven around by autonomous cars. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p> The effect machine learning will have on family and friends is understanding what machine learning does. There may be a bit of fear, and a bit of scepticism, but overall, I don&#8217;t consider this will affect them. The older members of my family may embrace the convenience that machine learning has to offer, especially in the medical field where their illnesses can be diagnosed with a better accuracy. With the younger generation of my family, machine learning is already part of their daily lives and to them it may be just another one of them things that they are completely innocent and unaware in how much it is an impact on their daily lives. </p>
