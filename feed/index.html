<h2><br>What does it do?</h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p> The Raspberry Pi is a minicomputer, the size of a credit card. It is a highly popular computer for creating, playing, programming and hacking, mainly because of its minimal price tag of $50AUD. The latest version is the Pi 4, which features two HDMI outputs! It contains a state of the art 64-bit ARM CPU clocked at 1.5GHZ, up to four gigabyte RAM and USB 3.0 for speedy data bandwidth. It contains 40 general purpose input/output which can be connected to virtually anything from motors to robots to other computers. An Ethernet port is bundled for Internet connectivity. Power is supplied by a USB-C port. </p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p> It is mostly used to create ingenious inventions that make life easier. For example, Dave Akerman blew up a balloon and tied a Raspberry Pi onto it and sent it to space. He took photos of the solar system and of the world that are now famous. His website [1]. Another example of a cool idea with the Pi is to connect it to a water pump, which you can then control when to spray water onto your garden, so you don’t have to do it yourself. It is particularly useful when going away from home for a long time, but don’t want your plants to die. A tutorial is available [2]. One of the best things about it is that it consumes very little power, so people often build clusters of Pis that work together to complete a task faster than a single Pi. One common use of it is to use it for a server, or as an IOT device. </p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> One of the things we will be able to do soon, when the Pi increases in processing power and decreases in size, is to play modern video games at a playable frame rate! Some people already have ditched their bulky x86-based CPU PCs in favour of the tiny computer, which we will see a lot more soon. Because nobody likes bulky computers, right? People might start embedding them in TVs and computer monitors so all you really need is the monitor! The increased processing power, and RAM will be useful for many things, which include using it as a server to host a website. I personally have done this myself. But in three years, the Pi might be powerful enough to host and maintain a game online, something similar to Agar.io [3]! I envision 300, maybe 500 Pis working together to render scenes for a game – maybe for VR or on an 8K TV – at 200+ frames per second. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p> I am going to discuss about the Pi clusters. Obviously, the hardware specifications are what makes all of the ideas possible. Although one of the developments that contribute is the speed of the internet. The most popular way to distribute tasks to each node – each Pi – is through the internet, so speed, especially latency (how fast each node responds) is important if you want to ensure speedy completion of a task. There need to be another computer to distribute tasks to each node, or you can use one of the nodes to do it. There are simple Python libraries that will accomplish this task. </p>



<h2> <em>What is the likely impact </em></h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<p> The potential impact of this development is huge. Computers will still get smaller and faster and consume less and less energy. Soon big, old black PC boxes will become a legend and something that few people remember. Another impact the Pi have made on our world is that it encourages us to tinker, program and hack, leading to children getting interested in programming, which is extremely important in a world that is covered in computers. Soon coding will be a necessary skill for each child and will be included in school curriculum all around the world. </p>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p> With the Pi, task automation is a perk that is very useful. Soon we won’t need to even get out of our bed. The Raspberry Pi or some other minicomputer will tip our bed over so that we land on our feet. Then it will serve us our breakfast, stuffing the food in your face. After that, it will dress us. Brush our teeth. The list goes on – you get the idea. </p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p> In my opinion, the people most affected by the phenomenon described in the last paragraph will be those who have a disability – not being able to look after themselves. Tiny computers, and most likely AI, will make sure that those people lead a healthy and happy lives. People without a disability, however, can still benefit from these computers in many ways, which include entertainment, productivity, content creation, among others. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p> The future is fuzzy – it is really difficult to predict what will happen – but one thing definitely will happen is since computers are taking over the world, job demand will plummet. I will list some examples of jobs that will become redundant as computer application evolves. One is carpentry, as there are now 3-D printers big enough to create buildings. Those machines will still need to be set up by people, though. Another example is people who work with shops – managers, people who stock goods, etc. Robots will replace them. Jobs that doesn’t require people to come up with original ideas, activities, etc, that is impossible for computers to do, will become a demand. </p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<p> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </p>



<p> It will obviously affect my everyday life as I have described above. Computers will do all our work that doesn’t require original ideas. Imagine the robots from the film WALL-E but apply it to the world (although not everyone will be really fat, it wouldn’t be healthy). I wouldn’t really have to do anything. Jobs that require programming and making up ideas will be the norm, so I will most likely be on the computer for the rest of my life – telling the computer – verbally &#8211; my ideas, and then the computer will convert them to code, which it will then automatically send it to a server or something – I have no idea! </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p> Since I am deaf, instead of verbally talking to the computer, I will be signing in Auslan to the computer, which then translates to code. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p> The affect Raspberry Pi or any other small computing devices will have on my family and friends is the ability of having an affordable computer that is also extremely portable. The ability to be able to communicate and share an idea with family members would affect them greatly, especially with the open source software these devices run on. A minicomputer the size of a flash drive would help friends understand what I am thinking not just understanding what I am saying. </p>

<h2> What does it do?</h2>



<h4> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h4>



<p> I am going to discuss about robots that try to imitate human or animal movement. I would say that the company that makes the latest and up-to-date robots is US- based Boston Dynamics. They design, and manufacture robots that focuses on agility and strength. They make robots that imitate human and animals’ movements. Their robots are battery-powered, thus making it portable. Their robots utilise hydraulic technology to move their limbs. Their latest human-inspired robot, named Atlas, released in 2013, is so agile that it can perform a backflip, and can-do parkour! However, they were built for search and rescue tasks. The processor and memory is unknown, as requested by the US Defence Advanced Research Project Agency, who funded Boston Dynamics for the building of the robot. Atlas have undergone various updates since the initiation in 2013, the latest one showcasing Atlas doing a handstand! The company also recently launched a robot named Spot. It moves in a similar fashion to dogs and is used for assisting constructing buildings. It is only available for specialized construction industries to purchase and use. It is customizable, offering attachments that expand its functionality. </p>



<h4> What can be done now? </h4>



<p> Boston Dynamics’ robots are capable of moving on rough terrain, which is handy for the construction industry and for the military. They can, using AI, detect hazards on the path they are walking in, and avert them by removing them or if unable to do so, walking around it. Their agility is so stable that even if you kick them or push them hard, as numerous people have done on YouTube videos, they will keep their ground and not tip over. Their robots are able to open doors and let people through, carry things of various shapes and sizes and have inbuilt cameras all over their bodies so that they can be remote controlled as well as wandering on their own.</p>



<h4> What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </h4>



<p> One of Dynamics’ robots, Spot, is being distributed to construction industries and in hope that it will assist them with dangerous tasks such as checking for an oil or gas leak. One of the issues with it is that it still cannot distinguish between soft and hard floor, such as a pile of dirt or cement. Thus, it is not stable and performs poorly in certain conditions. So, the answer to the question what it will be likely to do soon is it hopefully will be much more stable. Another issue is the small battery – it runs for one and half hours, then will need to be replaced. As AI evolves, robots will get smarter and avoid potential hazards and solve problems that could baffle humans. I don’t think they will be available to the general public for the next three years, or even ten, but the day when all of us have our own personal robot with AI is coming – soon. </p>



<h4> What technological or other developments make this possible? </h4>



<p> Boston Dynamics have been rather quiet about the specifications of their robots because their sponsors asked them to, but their robots use hydraulic powered joints to ensure that they can lift heavy weights. All of the robots’ chassis are 3-d printed to ensure that they remain lightweight and sturdy, not breaking when they fall over. Of course, AI and machine learning is a necessity for the robots to seem more humanlike. Scientists and engineers at Boston train the machines every day, as machine learning do their jobs of discovering how physics work. They need to upgrade the memory in the robots frequently with every software update which teaches the robots how to do more and more things. </p>



<h2> What is the likely impact </h2>



<h4> What is the potential impact of this development? </h4>



<p> The potential impact for this development is at the moment small. The robots are too expensive and unreliable, huge and heavy. They were designed with special tasks that is dangerous or even fatal for humans to do – such as helping the injured in a disaster where there are fire, gas or other dangers. However, Boston have programmed its Spot robot to be able to dance, so they can also be used for entertainment! With the help of Spot, which can carry up to 14kg, carpenters will complete buildings much faster and efficiently. </p>



<h4> What is likely to change? </h4>



<p>A list of what is likely to change, if Spot is sold to all construction companies:</p>



<p>1. Buildings will be completed faster. This also means that lots of carpenters and other people who work in the construction industry will lost their jobs.</p>



<p>2. The number of deaths from accidents while building buildings will reduce dramatically.</p>



<p>3. Spot was built with inspection in mind, so humans who are tired, sick or distracted, etc won’t be able to properly inspect buildings for dangerous situations, thus the robot can hopefully find and eliminate more dangers than humans.</p>



<p>4. In future upgrades, Spot will gain more functionality, maybe the ability to place brick and mortar and other muscle jobs, so it is likely that in the near future there won’t be any people at the construction site – only robots, remote controlled by humans far away!</p>



<h4> Which people will be most affected and how? </h4>



<p> The people most affected, naturally, will be those who work in the construction industry – by losing their jobs, as with many other muscle jobs that future robots will replace soon. </p>



<h4> Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies? </h4>



<p> Jobs that will become redundant like I mentioned above are carpenters. Technologies that will become redundant include various instruments that test wood, brick, wires, etc for faults because they will be embedded in robots. </p>



<h2> How will this affect you </h2>



<h4> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </h4>



<p> The evolution of robots that assist with constructing buildings won’t really affect my daily life, except for if a construction is going on nearby, as I walk or ride past, I will see a nest of robots working together, which is probably a little creepy. But if Boston programmed their robots to be able to fix motorbikes, then I would be out of a job, as I come to my local motorbike mechanic and clean up for the mechanics. </p>



<h4> What will be different for you? </h4>



<p> I have always dreamt of building my own house. But if robots did it for you, it would take away all the fun from building something original that really belong to you. </p>



<h4> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </h4>



<p>

As I have many friends who are tradesmen, when robots replace them, they will very likely lose their jobs and forced to work at McDonalds’ or something. They may even become homeless. They will be forced to pick an alternate route to gain a good income, one that may include undertaking a course to gain knowledge for a different job.

<p> Interview conducted 1st October 2019 with IT Professional (Darren)</p>



<p><em><strong>What type of work is done by the IT professional?</strong></em></p>



<p>The type of work that is done by Darren consists of, installation of computer hardware, software and maintenance. When possible, with most of the software installation and updating this is completed remotely to try to minimise site visits. He is also involved in network and telephone patching as well as backup support.</p>



<p><strong><em>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with?</em></strong></p>



<p>The people Darren interacts with are various stakeholders ranging from the administration staff to managers, but most of the interactions are with other IT professional colleagues that are within his team, including the local area IT manager with most of the interaction consisting of knowledge base sharing.</p>



<p>Every now and again Darren will complete a site visit and have a formal one to one interaction with the client but where possible this is done by either a telephone conversation, email, Skype or remote connections with their computer.</p>



<p><strong><em>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</em></strong></p>



<p>Darren spends most of his time within the IT department office, as the majority of his workload can be completed via remote access to his client’s hardware were, he is able to correct most of the client’s issues.</p>



<p><strong><em>What aspect of their position is the most challenging?</em></strong></p>



<p>Darren finds the most challenging part of the job is with coordination with other IT teams. Were he is having to coordinate and complete a job request from other IT teams only to find out that the other IT teams may have not completed their part of the assigned job within the allotted time.</p>
