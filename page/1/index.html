<p>That Team is a collaboration of 4 hardworking individuals coming together to achieve the common goal of completing this assignment. Throughout this assessment we have compared industry data and relevancy in the IT industry, developed a better understanding of the day to day workings of an IT professional, compared 4 different upcoming technologies and developed an outstanding project idea. Unfortunately we did not use Github as out main means of communication and merely as a means for hosting our website, however, we have included an audit trail from Microsoft Teams which perfectly reflects our groups work and each individuals input. </p>

<p>

I came to Australia over 20 years ago from England with the intension of having a better life, but most importantly giving my children a better life. Up until we emigrated, I lived just outside London being the stereotypical ‘Eastender / cockney’. Completed senior school with enough to get me a job and thought life. After completing school, I started an electrical apprenticeship’ and became an electrician after 4 long years, since then I have been an electrician all of my working life. Since the IT industry has merged more and more into the electrical trade, I became more interested in it and since being in Australia I have completed a Diploma in IT which I have great pride in, and it has also helped in the aspects of my trade.

<p><a href="https://misha-ate-soup.github.io/RMITAssignment/index.html">https://misha-ate-soup.github.io/RMITAssignment/index.html</a></p>



<p> I was born and grew up in Melbourne. Some of my great-grandparents came from Russia, and some from Britain. I have completed primary school at Eastwood Primary School and have been studying at home for my secondary school education. I have completed two online courses prior to this one – The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) part one and two. Certificate of completion is available here and here. I currently communicate using Auslan, and written English. Since I am deaf, I cannot hear or speak English. Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing with my go-kart, and programming games in Lua on my Ti-Nspire CX CAS calculator. My interest in IT officially began when I was about eight years  old, and my neighbour left her old computer on her nature strip, so I brought it home and connected it and got it to work successfully. </p>



<h2> Rahnny Tajaran </h2>



<h4> Student number s3818720</h4>



<p><a href="https://rahnny01.github.io/MyProfile/">https://rahnny01.github.io/MyProfile/</a></p>



<p>

I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology and Working full time in the Hospitality industry. I was born in the Philippines and migrated here when I was 17. I speak Filipino and English. My favourite sport is basketball. I have a daughter; her name is Zoe and she means the world to me. My interest in IT is programming and cybersecurity. It started when I was in high school. I was always good with computers and when my family have troubles with them, I was the one they always go to. My interest sparked in cybersecurity when I first watched Mr. Robot. I liked the idea of defending cyberattacks and strategizing against hackers. What makes a good I.T person and what path to take in the industry? I really would love to learn more of the technical side of I.T because it interests me the most.

<h2> Brendan Dilworth </h2>



<h4> Student number s3750271 </h4>



<p><a href="https://brendand-byte.github.io/">https://brendand-byte.github.io/</a></p>



<p> My interests in I.T. started at a young age, I loved playing games and through school started learning about databases and doing some light coding. I always enjoyed taking old computers apart although I had no idea what I was doing and learning about all of the different hardware components. I have experiences doing light coding, developing robots, using a 3D printer and mechanical components, and developing websites from previous studies or personal interest. Through my studies, am hoping to develop a better understanding of what tools there are out there that I can implement them into my financial planning career, to make my own job easier and better help my future clients. In the future, I would love to develop a program which uses statistical techniques to analyse investment options based on an outlines risk profile and historic data from the ASX. </p>



<h2> Alexander Piras</h2>



<h4> Student number s3819239  </h4>



<p>

My name is Alexander Piras, I am 24 years old. I have grown up in the inner-west suburbs of Sydney with my big Italian family. I was brought up in a working middle-class family and am one of three children (two older sisters, I know poor me). I can speak fluent Italian thanks to my Nonni, and basic conversational German thanks to my primary and secondary education. I have travelled eleven countries extensively, a list that I hope to keep expanding in the future. My interest in IT extends beyond the career realm and is actually a personal agenda of my own. I was very young, possibly 9 or 10 years old when I first started customising my PC desktop at home. I would always be eager to download programs that would enhance the computers capabilities. I guess I could say my dad was the one that sparked my interest as he was always encouraging me to pull it all apart and see the hardware behind the PC. He would always support my quest to figure out the way it worked and fiddle with the applications on it.

<p>Brendan: Personality Trait O-48% C-79% E-25% A-85% N-25%</p>



<h4>Reflection</h4>



<p>

With these results of the team, there is a good cross section of personalities that will not clash. The team as a whole, consists of a cross section of people that are productive and dedicated. They are problem solvers that want to look to the future rather than the past. There are members of the team that will keep the team organised and on track and I feel this team will work well together to produce the end result.

</p>



<h2>Our Ideal Jobs Compared</h2>



<p>With
the group members of this team there is no common element as such with the
ideal jobs. Each person has a different field in IT that their ideal job
requires, Programing, Data Analysts, Cyber Security and Networking. The
difference in these areas cover a main part of the IT industry, from the hard
wiring to programming to analyzing software and security. With this team’s
career plans being so different, it seems to me, that it would be possible for
this team to form an IT company that could offer an IT service from start to
finish.</p>



<h2>Audit Trail</h2>



<p>[9/30 2:56 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I’m here!</p>



<p>[9/30 5:18 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Mike, how things going with your assessment 2 and weekly tasks? My weekly are going ok, Assessment 2 have started to do ‘IT Technologies’ and hope to get ‘IT Work’ done soon</p>



<p>[9/30 9:00 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey Colin Batiste, i’m a bit behind in weekly tasks so I am trying to catch up this week. I haven’t started on Assessment 2, we probably should wait for the others to show up…</p>



<p>[10/3 9:19 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I’m doing the IT Technologies for the Raspberry Pi and Robots reports, so don’t do them – that’s my job!</p>



<p>[10/4 3:31 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey Brendan Dilworth, can we have a look at the website? Can you give us a link to it?</p>



<p>[10/5 2:15 PM] Brendan Dilworth of course! Url is that-team.com (If it doesn’t work get rid of the “www.”) Github repository URL: https://github.com/BrendanDRMIT/BrendanDRMIT.github.io.git</p>



<p>[10/5 6:57 PM] Michael Souprounovich Thanks much! Did you use WordPress or some other website creating tool?</p>



<p>[Monday 7:21 AM] Brendan Dilworth using wordpress but because they want the site hosted by github i’m having to convert it to a static site and upload the site files into the github repository after every edit.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:41 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Rahnny if you can do the Industry Data that would be great, You will have to go to the GitHub sites of all of us and work from that information. I would work on the information you have at the moment with our sites and when the others join, add their info into it. Don’t want to have a big panic near time of submission.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:26 AM] Rahnny Tajaran Hey guys! This is my first time using ms teams.. I had a look at the website and it looks cool! I will try and do the industry data report if no one has started it yet 🙂</p>



<p>[Monday 6:08 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey Rahnny, we have 3 IT tech reports done, and I’m working on the last one, so yeah, it would be awesome if you could do the industry data, as Colin Batiste said.</p>



<p>[10/5 8:30 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I have uploaded the report for the Raspberry Pi for IT Technologies to the Files tab. Obviously it is not perfect, and I am having a little problem with the last section – how it will affect life. I am having difficulty in finding something to write about. Contributions and suggestions will be greatly appreciated! I am now working on the robots report.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:09 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Michael i have added a bit to the end of your Raspberry Pi. Have a look and either reword or scrap, what ever you think fit</p>



<p>[Monday 6:08 PM] Michael Souprounovich Thanks mate! I’ll have a look now. It’s perfect! Thanks!</p>



<p>[10/3 12:45 AM] Colin Batiste Hi all, I have put a doc in the Files Tab (above). in it you can see what has been done and what hasn’t. Please pick any item to be done, put your name next to it and complete ready for submission. Brendan if you have completed the items with a (?) put a Done in there. Also are you happy with us sending you the Tasks for you to post on the web site?</p>



<p>[10/4 3:12 PM] Brendan Dilworth of course, send them through, i’ll post them to the site.</p>



<p>[10/5 1:10 AM] Colin Batiste Hi Brendan I have uploaded IT Work if it posts on the web site alright then I will upload other docs. Everybody else, have a look and see what you think.</p>



<p>[10/5 2:10 PM] Brendan Dilworth I have uploaded this into the tasks section of the website (that-team.com) go check it out and let me know what you think, it is still very bare as I havent received any content yet besides the IT work.</p>



<p>[Monday 5:20 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Brendan The (that-team.com) link is is a dead link for me, it points me to www.that-team.com is that right?</p>



<p>[Monday 6:11 PM] Michael Souprounovich No, it doesn’t have the www. Just type “that-team.com” into your browser’s search bar.</p>



<p>[Monday 9:02 PM] Colin Batiste hi Brendan web site looks great, thank-you, thanks Michael for pointing me in the right direction. My web site in assessment 1 sucks, big time, hope what I have is ok for this assessment. Brendan Iv uploaded a new version of IT Work as I think all submissions are to be in ‘Harvard Style’.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:08 PM] Brendan Dilworth Great, i’ll check it out and upload it to the site</p>



<p>[Monday 9:29 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan i have also uploaded 2 new docs, for the ‘IT Technologies’ section, Blockchain and Machine Learning</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:09 PM] Brendan Dilworth Great i’ll check it out and upload it to the site</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:13 PM] Brendan Dilworth Lets try and chase down those last 2 websites and i’ll see what i can do on the site to make it look good, Maybe putting them in as buttons with a little snip of each persons profile?</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:18 PM] Michael Souprounovich Sounds good!</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:19 PM] Colin Batiste iv sent them another message in Canvas, working that they will not be comeing</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:23 PM] Michael Souprounovich The others aren’t coming? What do you mean?</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:24 PM] Colin Batiste have not heard from them since we started, not sure if they are still here</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:29 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan if you could post your github web site i can complete the Personal Information part also it will help Rahnny with his Industry Data.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:31 PM] Colin Batiste Michael hows Robots going?</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:32 PM] Michael Souprounovich Good, about halfway done. Working on it right now.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:38 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan, Rahnny, Michael, Alexander, Chol Everybody we need to have an idea for a Project Idea. My assessment 1 was to have automated street lighting</p>



<p>[Tuesday 2:40 PM] Michael Souprounovich Colin Batiste Mine was to emulate a old video game console in Minecraft. Maybe a little too technical for everyone…</p>



<p>[Tuesday 3:11 PM] Rahnny Tajaran Mine was an app for combatting plastic pollution and raising awareness.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 3:23 PM] Brendan Dilworth My Project idea was an AI investor program using historic data compared against an individuals risk profile and asset allocation preferences to recommend buying and selling assets to continuously balance risk and maximise profit.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 6:13 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hello everyone, I have completed the robots report. Please refer to the file I have uploaded.</p>



<p>[Tuesday 9:05 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan, Michael, Rahnny Ok everyone Assessment 2 has to be submitted by end of this week, lots to do. Brendan don’t submit to web site yet as all information has to be in 1 PDF doc then submitted. All submissions have to be in the Harvard Style format, Michael im going to reformat your Pi and Robots to that style. Rahnny you should have the Industry Data information you need now to complete. All of the Project Ideas are great i don’t think we should think of a new one so im ok with Brendan’s ( as long as you can have it done by the end of the week). Feedback looks like we don’t have to do (its not working)</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:22 AM] Colin Batiste Rahnny hows the Industry Data going? if any problems let me know. Also could you submit a 200 word report for Group Reflection</p>



<p>[Tuesday 10:21 PM] Colin Batiste Michael i have altered your reports, if happy with them let me know</p>



<p>[Yesterday 7:33 AM] Michael Souprounovich Looks good, thanks!</p>



<p>[Yesterday 7:35 AM] Michael Souprounovich Colin Batiste, anything else you want me to do?</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:19 AM] Colin Batiste Hi Michael glad you like it. In Group Reflection we all have to submit 200 words each and 400 words as a group, if you want to do that? I will be working on my 200 words soon.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:27 AM] Michael Souprounovich I’m on it.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 3:01 PM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I have completed my group reflection and have uploaded the file.</p>

<p>[Yesterday 6:53 PM] Michael Souprounovich Neat!</p>



<p>[Yesterday 11:28 AM] Colin Batiste Brendan is Project Ideas still ok? Also could you submit a 200 word report for Group Reflection and comments for Tools and don’t forget the GitHub site</p>



<p>[Yesterday 8:52 PM] Brendan Dilworth I have just uploaded my group reflection and project idea (this is the same as on my site) give me some feedback if you guys want to add anything or whatever.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 9:34 PM] Colin Batiste Hi all have uploaded Team Profile and my Group Reflection</p>



<p>[1:35 AM] Colin Batiste Brendan Michael Rahnny I have uploaded Group Reflection Team, it needs to be about 400 words long. please add something to it. thanks</p>



<p>[3:26 PM] Brendan Dilworth check out this link and let me know what you think, if you like it i will format all like this. http://that-team.com/2019/10/10/raspberry-pi-report/</p>



<p>[1:37 PM] Colin Batiste Hello Brendan, Michael and Rahnny Well this is almost it, I feel the submitted tasks are great, Rahnny please upload Industry Data and your Group Reflection.</p>



<p>I think their only 3 other items to do, Ideal Jobs, Comments in Tools and for everybody to chip in to Group Reflection Team. Feedback in SparkPLUS will need to be done by all of us also. Don’t forget the assessment has to be submitted this week as a PDF Report, you ok to do that Brendan? Im not going to be here for the next few days but will catch up with you all at the weekend.</p>



<p>[2:05 PM] Brendan Dilworth To confirm, What exactly would you like me to do ? do you want me to upload all onto the website and print each page into the same pdf ?</p>



<p>[2:33 PM] Colin Batiste Hi Brendan, I think the tasks need to be “Formatted and presented in a PDF Report” then uploaded to the group site.</p>



<p>Not sure if in 1 PDF or a PDF for each task, im thinking a PDF for each task</p>



<p>[2:37 PM] Brendan Dilworth Okay, interesting. what I might do is upload them individually as group posts (this will look nice) and I will include a link on each post with a PDF version. what i can then do is collate all of them into one pdf containing the whole assignment and link that on the home page. just to be sure.</p>



<p>[2:40 PM] Colin Batiste Sound good to me</p>



<p>[2:48 PM] Colin Batiste Over the next day or so check if Rahnny has submitted his parts</p>



<p>[2:49 PM] Colin Batiste Im trying to get the IDEAL JOBS part done</p>



<p>[3:06 PM] Brendan Dilworth so all that’s left for me to do is the site stuff ? (converting to pdf’s and uploading to the site)</p>



<p>[3:13 PM] Colin Batiste ‘Comments on how well the audit trail reflects the groups work’</p>



<p>Add something to the GROUP Reflection</p>



<p>Complete SparkPLUS</p>



<p>Check for Rahnnys reports</p>



<p>Upload in a few days and have a beer</p>



<p>[3:27 PM] Brendan Dilworth so i have looked back over the task sheet, will we be submitting an activity log from Microsoft teams? i assume they will reference this for ” how well the audit trail reflects the groups work”</p>



<p>[3:31 PM] Colin Batiste Web Site looks great</p>



<p>[3:32 PM] Colin Batiste Have looked into downloading the logs for our chat but MS Teams hasn’t enabled that to be done yet</p>



<p>[3:33 PM] Colin Batiste either its screen shots or cut and paste</p>



<p>[3:39 PM] Brendan Dilworth could we maybe include a link to the channel ? (like the one below)(https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a237daa52a78d4ee7812961b010cd37a5%40thread.skype/General?groupId=3ff58a2b-4fda-498a-a66f-60c543b282a9&tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b)</p>



<p>[3:35 PM] Colin Batiste Have just uploaded Ideal Jobs, bit rushed, see what you think</p>



<p>[3:40 PM] Brendan Dilworth Cheers Colin, i’m trying to get as much work done this arv as i can so will have a look.</p>



<p>[4:23 PM] Colin Batiste Brendan had a look at the link, i don’t think it will work as permission would need to be given to whoever want to access teams im looking at other way to do it</p>



<p>[4:24 PM] Brendan Dilworth I thought this might be the case but was unsure, let me know how you go</p>



<p>[Thursday 4:51 PM] Colin Batiste OK i think i have cut and paste all of the chat</p>



<p>Will work on it later and upload Friday night or Saturday</p>



<p>[Thursday 4:53 PM] Colin Batiste Have to go now, will log in over the weekend</p>



<p>[Thursday 3:26 PM] Brendan Dilworth check out this link and let me know what you think, if you like it i will format all like this. http://that-team.com/2019/10/10/raspberry-pi-report/</p>

<p>[Yesterday 1:05 AM] Rahnny Tajaran Hey guys my apologies currently dealing with family issues but will be looking to finish the report soon..</p>



<p>[Yesterday 8:42 AM] Michael Souprounovich Hey everyone, I have completed my feedback on this group on sparkPLUS. I am not sure if my feedback is available for everyone to see…</p>



<p>[Yesterday 1:25 PM] Rahnny Tajaran Hi Team, I have uploaded the industry data report. I am not sure if the format is correct but feel free to correct any mistakes. Apologies on the delay. I will now be doing the group reflection.</p>



<p>[Yesterday 3:54 PM] Brendan Dilworth Hey all, go check out the website (http://that-team.com/) i’m still waiting on some content from you guys, if I could get that posted in here tonight would be great so that I can upload it to the site tomorrow. If you make any edits to anything already on the site, make sure that you let me know so that I can update it. In the PDF page on the website i will collate all of the individual files into one pdf and post it there, i will also generate a pdf for each page on the site and merge them. this will look nicer and more formatted compared to the alternative. still a bit to do so the sooner we can get the remaining content complete the better!</p>



<p>[Yesterday 7:49 PM] Michael Souprounovich It’s looking great!</p>

Souprounovich</p>



<p>Group Processes look good, but
when I tried to visit the link you provided at the bottom of the doc, it said
access denied. So you may want to include the feedback directly on the doc.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[30/10 15:10] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>I have removed the link as i
think it was only for my login. Will ask RMIT if they consider the doc. should
be part of this assessment</p>



<p>​</p>

20:05] Michael Souprounovich</p>



<p>Hi That
Team, since I will be at work all day tomorrow and likely to be unable to
continue with Assessment 5, I have uploaded a file that include my VERY rough
draft that includes a “storyline” embedded in it as comments. It is a
heterogeneous mixture of text I scavenged from Rough draft Plans and
Progress.docx and Group Project Introduction (Brendan).docx from Assessment 3,
along with some text of my own. Any help with making it more interesting and
oral friendly will be much appreciated! I have completed everything up to the
green text.</p>



<p>[31/10
15:06] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Assessment
5</p>



<p>That
Team hello all, please all look at the storyboard and script i have put in
Assessment 5. Michael would it be possible if you are able to place
yourself within the video where i have put ‘M’ doing (if you can) <em>sign
language</em> and with sub titles at the bottom?? also if you think you can
follow the storyboard as a video let me know ASAP so that it can be submitted
on Sunday.</p>



<p>The video
only need to be about 5 mins long and 2:30 is going to be taken up with the
Glenn Highway video downloaded so the script itself only needs to be only
about 2 mins long. Think your idea of clips within the video is great. Don’t
think all of us need to be introduced is required. All the stuff below
green line I don’t think is needed. There is about 2 weeks to work on the
video.</p>



<p>Speak to
you soon </p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[31/10 16:58] Michael

<p>Colin Batiste Looks great!
I’ll be more than happy to.</p>



<p>[02/11

<p>That
Team Hi all, if ok with everyone i will be submitting the first part
of Assessment 5 Sunday evening, let me know before then if you think there
should be any changes.  </p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[02/11 15:38] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>It looks good to me, go ahead and
submit</p>



<p>[03/11

<p>Assessment
5 Part 1 submitted</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[04/11 07:35] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Hi Colin Batiste, anything I can
do to help? I’m free and bored…</p>



<p>Edited</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[04/11 10:04] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Hi Michael <strong>Group Reflection</strong> you
need to complete a 200 word perception of how you think the group went. Also
400 words from the group as a whole will need to be submitted.</p>



<p><strong>Scope and Limits</strong> needs to be completed and
also <strong>Skills and Jobs </strong>needs to be compleated</p>



<p>How is the video going? you still
ok with it?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[04/11 10:16] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>I’ll be happy to do the scope and
limits, and the skills and jobs. I’m still happy to film myself signing, but we
need a actual script, not a draft one like you submitted for Assessment 5. I
could help write that too.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[04/11 13:24] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>No problem i will work on
something as a rough idea </p>



<p>Edited</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[04/11 17:50] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Michael on average, how many
words do you sign in a minute ?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 07:38] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Colin Batiste It varies
wildly. How fast do you want me sign? I can go anywhere from 0.1 words per
second to 10.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 07:39] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Depends on the audience.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 11:07] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Hi Michael just wanted to
know how many words would be needed for the script, also have to think
about people following the subtitles at the bottom</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 18:24] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>No worries, I can sign a bit
slower so that people can catch up with the subtitles. If you like, I can
upload a quick video of me signing something random with subtitles and you can
give me some feedback – is it too slow or too fast?</p>



<p>            [05/11
19:24] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Great idea</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 19:35] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Ok, i’m on it. </p>



<p>[05/11
19:38] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Good
stuff, you still ok with Scope & Limits and also Skills & Jobs?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 19:43] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Haven’t started either yet,
planning on doing them tomorrow.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 19:58] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Hi, have attached the video, let
me know what you think</p>



<p>[test.mp4]</p>



<p>(https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/sites/ThatTeam/Shared
Documents/General/test.mp4)</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 20:10] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Ok problem im having is,
Subtitles are to quick and unable to read them. The start was fine, middle to
end was to fast for me to read</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 20:12] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Hmm, looks OK to me… Maybe I’m
too used to reading subtitles, haha… gotcha, will keep that in mind when I do
the actual signing.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 20:12] Michael Souprounovich</p>



<p>You OK working on the draft?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 20:23] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Ok, In assessment 5 i have
uploaded (Michaels Draft Script), see what you think, it will need to be
tweaked a bit </p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[05/11 20:31] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>I think it looks fantastic,
although I think it may be short on information. Maybe try adding more details
about how it works – like how they use sensors to “see” the car
moving and switch on lights say, 1km ahead to ensure that you are never in the
dark. Also, include the face that IOT can be used to sense car accidents and
switch on or off the lights accordingly.</p>

<p>Michael i have re-uploaded a
script, have a look and see comments at bottom. I think it will need to to
have a bit more tweaking, depends on what you can do with it</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[06/11 08:49] Michael

<p>I think it looks MUCH better!!</p>

<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:45] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Hi Colin Batiste, I have
completed the skills and jobs. Uploaded the file. </p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:52] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>HI Michael have you read the
Scopes and Limits? are you happy with it ? With scopes i worked on the
S.M.A.R.T. principal </p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:54] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Just read it, and I realized that
I was wrong all the time – so you ARE planning to do a hardware upgrade –
installing new hardware into the lights! I thought all the time that it was
only a software upgrade. Whoops! Looks like I need to update skills and
jobs!</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:56] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>NO hardware up grade, working on
the principal that there will be some sort of hardware install in each light
(Switching ect.)</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:57] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Wait, so no hardware upgrade, but
installing NEW hardware in the lights? Aren’t they the same?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:58] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>So it is just adding new hardware
onto the existing hardware?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 18:59] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Nah, think of it as if you was
installing more Memory into your computer, your not upgrading the existing mem
just adding new mem</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:00] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Ahh, thanks for explaining
clearly, got it!</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:00] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>No problem</p>



<p>            [07/11

are good, no comment needed.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:04] Michael

reflection now if that’s OK.</p>

Where’s the script????</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:09] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Assessment 4 is pretty simple:
Just reflect on your best forum posts.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:11] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Script Assessment 5 Michael Draft
Script, check the bottom of script for notes i added</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:16] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Oh, so that is our good script.
We should change the file name to just “script”, not draft script to
avoid confusion (laugh)</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:16] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Didnt want to change it until all
happy with it</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:17] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>I’m very happy with it. It’s
simple enough to sign, and very clear.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[07/11 19:17] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>I can start filming myself
signing tomorrow with the help of my younger siblings.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[08/11 00:41] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Michael have checked your Skills
and Jobs and you only have 3 positions in there (should be 4), could you whip
up another position to put in?</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[08/11 07:46] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Colin Batiste Whoops! I’ll
do it now.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[08/11 08:06] Michael

<p>Colin Batiste Done! </p>



<p>            [08/11
14:44] Brendan Dilworth</p>



<p>Yep i am all good, just been
waiting for things to start coming together so that i can do my remaining
sections (laugh) </p>



<p>[08/11
19:46] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Worst
case scenario</p>



<p>That
Team hi all i think we will have to look at the worst case scenario in
regards to items that Rahnny was completing. He may not be able to submit
in time so i think we will have to look at getting a draft done for each
of the tasks. They are <strong>Tools & Technologies, Timeframe </strong>and <strong>Risks.</strong> If
anyone has a spare moment could you have a look and get a draft done ?</p>



<p>Edited</p>

uploaded files, then you alter them to make them better. So are you sorry?</p>

<p>[Tuesday 11:13] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Miss communication, I read your
Group Reflection and relised (Thought) you was not happy about your tasks being
altered </p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[Tuesday 11:15] Michael
Souprounovich</p>



<p>Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot,
sometimes you change things too much so that they look like they were written
by you instead of me, haha! It’s alright mate, truth is I don’t really care.</p>



<p>Edited</p>



<p>[Tuesday
11:24] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Mate nope
your right, I overstepped the mark, I did alter some to much and at the end of

<p>Hi Colin Batiste, I have
completed the Tools and Technologies. Please read it and let me know if there
are any errors or things you think I should add/remove. Thanks!</p>

Brendan and Rahnny I have added to Michaels Group Reflection. We need
to have about 400 words, would it be possible if 1 or both of you could
add something to build it up. Thanks (Group Reflection (Michael Colin)) </p>

more work tomorrow on all of my assessment if there is anything you guys need
done (smile)</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[Tuesday 15:33] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>i cant think of anything at the

<p>​</p>



<p>[Tuesday 16:22] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Hi Brendan just tidying
things up, you ok in doing the link to group website and GitHub?</p>

<p>Hey all,
I have just uploaded “comments on audit trail” hopefully you guys all
agree with what i have written feel free to have a look and let me know if
there is anything i have missed or you want me to review</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[Wednesday 23:11] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Hi Brendan looks excellent,
the only thing i would change is the Font (Arial) Size (12) Align Left,
Line spacing (Double) and a Title,</p>



<p>[Wednesday
19:14] Michael Souprounovich</p>



<p>That
Team Hi all! I have finished shooting myself (*chuckles*) and edited the
footage and uploaded video files in a new folder Video. I uploaded the video as
fragments of scenes, so can you all please have a look at them and if all is
OK, then I will merge them all into one final video.</p>



<p>​</p>



<p>[Thursday 00:38] Colin Batiste</p>



<p>Michael have uploaded Tools and Tech
Ideas, have a look and see what you think</p>

<p>Near the
End</p>



<p>That
Team Hello all just to let you know im not going to be on here over the
next few days, will be back Sunday.</p>



<p>Brendan
could you double check everything to be submitted (I was formatting the tasks
in Arial, size 12, Align Left and double space)</p>



<p>Not sure
what is happening with Rahnny, think he came in at the last moment on the last
assessment.</p>



<p>Have
uploaded Test Results (From the last assessment) needed for Team Profile</p>



<p>Fill free
to rework my work if you think is necessary </p>



<p>I think
all that is missing is Risks and Timeframe</p>



<p>At the
end of the day we want to pass this assessment</p>



<p>As I said
i will be back on here Sunday afternoon/evening so if I don’t speak to you
then, I would like to say Thankyou its been fun (laugh)</p>

nearing the 5-minute limit, I had to take out the 2mins 30secs Glenn Highway
video from the final video to make space for the more relevant information.</p>

<p>[11:18] Michael Souprounovich</p>



<p>Hi all, I have completed the
video. I have uploaded the file, called That Team – Automated Street
Lighting.mp4. I will submit it tomorrow (Sunday) at 9pm so if you see any
mistakes or have any suggestions, PLEASE TELL ME before I submit!!! </p>

<p>I have uploaded the signed
Contributions Form. I have omitted Rahnny from it as he did not contribute at
all. Thus the only people on it are Colin, Brendan and me.</p>

<p>Hi Michael
Souprounovich sorry due to unforeseen circumstances I had to drop
everything and could not do any of the task. My deepest apologies to the
group but please let me do the timeframe and will submit asap. I really
need this assessment passed. </p>

judgement and am confident its going to look fantastic! </p>
